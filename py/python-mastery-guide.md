#### Topic 2: Basic Syntax and Variables
Students will be assessed on their ability to:

**2.1 Understand Python's syntax rules and indentation requirements**

**2.1.1 Identify basic Python syntax rules**
*Guidance: Students should be able to recognize that Python statements are typically written one per line and do not require terminating semicolons (though they can be used). They should understand that Python is case-sensitive and that keywords are reserved words with special meanings. Students should be able to identify valid and invalid syntax examples.*

**2.1.2 Understand the significance of indentation in Python**
*Guidance: Students should recognize that indentation is not just for readability in Python but is used to define code blocks and structure. They should understand that consistent indentation is required and that mixing spaces and tabs can cause errors. Students should be able to identify code blocks based on indentation levels.*

**2.1.3 Apply proper indentation for different code structures**
*Guidance: Students should be able to correctly indent code for various structures including conditional statements, loops, functions, and classes. They should understand the standard practice of using 4 spaces per indentation level (as per PEP 8) and be able to identify incorrect indentation that would lead to IndentationError or unexpected behavior.*

**2.1.4 Create and use comments in Python code**
*Guidance: Students should be able to write single-line comments using the hash symbol (#) and multi-line comments using triple quotes (""" or '''). They should understand the purpose of comments for code documentation and be able to distinguish between comments that explain code purpose versus those that explain complex logic.*

**2.1.5 Implement line continuation techniques**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use line continuation techniques for long statements, including explicit line continuation with a backslash (\) and implicit line continuation within parentheses, brackets, or braces. They should understand when and why line continuation might be necessary.*

**2.1.6 Recognize and apply whitespace rules**
*Guidance: Students should understand Python's whitespace rules, including when whitespace is significant (indentation) and when it is insignificant (around operators and delimiters). They should be able to apply appropriate whitespace for readability while following PEP 8 guidelines.*

**2.2 Know how to create and use variables**

**2.2.1 Create variables and assign values**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create variables using the assignment operator (=) and assign values of different types. They should understand that variables are references to objects in memory, not containers themselves. Students should be able to write simple assignment statements and understand the direction of the assignment (right to left).*

**2.2.2 Reassign values to existing variables**
*Guidance: Students should be able to reassign new values to existing variables, understanding that this changes the object the variable references. They should be able to recognize that variables can be reassigned to values of different types due to Python's dynamic typing.*

**2.2.3 Delete variables using the del statement**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the del statement to remove the reference to an object, understanding that this may lead to the object being garbage collected if no other references exist. They should understand the difference between deleting a variable and setting it to None.*

**2.2.4 Implement multiple assignment techniques**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use multiple assignment techniques including tuple unpacking (e.g., x, y = 10, 20), chained assignment (e.g., x = y = 5), and augmented assignment (e.g., x += 1). They should understand how these techniques work and when each might be appropriate.*

**2.2.5 Understand basic variable scope**
*Guidance: Students should have a basic understanding of variable scope, recognizing that variables created in different parts of code may have different accessibility. They should understand the difference between local and global scope at a fundamental level, though detailed scope rules will be covered in later topics.*

**2.3 Understand Python's dynamic typing system**

**2.3.1 Explain the concept of dynamic typing**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that Python is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime and variables can change type. They should contrast this with statically typed languages where types are determined at compile time and variables typically cannot change type.*

**2.3.2 Check the type of variables and objects**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the type() function to determine the type of a variable or object. They should understand how to interpret the output of type() and recognize different built-in types such as int, float, str, bool, list, etc.*

**2.3.3 Perform type conversion between basic types**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use built-in functions such as int(), float(), str(), bool(), etc., to convert values between different types. They should understand potential issues with conversion (e.g., converting a non-numeric string to a float) and how to handle or avoid such errors.*

**2.3.4 Understand type inference**
*Guidance: Students should recognize that Python infers the type of a variable based on the assigned value. They should understand that while Python is dynamically typed, each object has a specific type that determines what operations can be performed on it.*

**2.3.5 Recognize the implications of dynamic typing**
*Guidance: Students should be able to discuss the advantages (flexibility, faster prototyping) and disadvantages (potential runtime errors, reduced code clarity) of dynamic typing. They should understand how dynamic typing affects code development, testing, and debugging.*

**2.4 Be able to use naming conventions and best practices**

**2.4.1 Apply PEP 8 naming conventions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply PEP 8 naming conventions, including using lowercase with underscores for variable names (snake_case), UPPER_CASE for constants, and CapitalizedWords for class names (though classes will be covered in more detail later). They should understand the importance of consistent naming.*

**2.4.2 Identify and avoid Python reserved keywords**
*Guidance: Students should be able to recognize Python's reserved keywords (such as if, else, for, while, def, class, etc.) and understand that these cannot be used as variable names. They should be able to identify when a variable name conflicts with a reserved keyword.*

**2.4.3 Create meaningful and descriptive variable names**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create variable names that clearly indicate their purpose or content. They should understand the importance of descriptive names over single-letter names (except in specific contexts like loop counters) and be able to evaluate the quality of variable names.*

**2.4.4 Follow best practices for variable naming**
*Guidance: Students should understand and apply best practices such as avoiding names that could be confused with built-in functions or types, using consistent naming patterns within a program, and avoiding abbreviations unless widely understood. They should understand how good naming practices contribute to code readability and maintainability.*

**2.4.5 Identify and correct common naming mistakes**
*Guidance: Students should be able to identify common naming mistakes such as using leading or trailing underscores inappropriately, using non-ASCII characters, creating names that are too generic or too verbose, and using inconsistent naming patterns. They should be able to correct these issues in existing code.*



#### Topic 3: Data Types
Students will be assessed on their ability to:

**3.1 Understand and use basic data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans**

**3.1.1 Define and use integers**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that integers (int) are whole numbers without decimal points, either positive or negative. They should be able to create integer literals (e.g., 42, -17, 0) and understand that integers in Python 3 have arbitrary precision, limited only by available memory. Students should be able to perform arithmetic operations with integers, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), floor division (//), modulus (%), and exponentiation (**). They should understand the results of these operations and when the result might be a float rather than an integer.*

**3.1.2 Define and use floating-point numbers**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that floating-point numbers (float) represent real numbers with decimal points. They should be able to create float literals (e.g., 3.14, -0.001, 2.0) and understand scientific notation (e.g., 1.5e2 = 150.0). Students should understand that floats are represented in binary internally, which can lead to precision issues (e.g., 0.1 + 0.2 ≠ 0.3). They should be able to perform arithmetic operations with floats and understand concepts like precision limits and the special values float('inf'), float('-inf'), and float('nan').*

**3.1.3 Define and use strings**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that strings (str) are sequences of Unicode characters used to represent text. They should be able to create string literals using single quotes ('hello'), double quotes ("world"), and triple quotes ('''multiline''' or """multiline"""). Students should understand escape sequences (e.g., \n for newline, \t for tab, \\ for backslash) and string concatenation using the + operator. They should be able to access individual characters using indexing (e.g., s[0]) and substrings using slicing (e.g., s[1:3]).*

**3.1.4 Define and use booleans**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that booleans (bool) represent truth values, either True or False. They should understand that booleans are a subclass of integers, with True equivalent to 1 and False equivalent to 0. Students should be able to create boolean literals and understand boolean operations: and, or, and not. They should be able to evaluate boolean expressions and understand the concept of truthy and falsy values in Python (e.g., 0, 0.0, None, empty sequences are falsy; non-zero numbers, non-empty sequences are truthy).*

**3.1.5 Apply appropriate data types to solve problems**
*Guidance: Students should be able to select the most appropriate data type for different scenarios. For example, using integers for counting, discrete quantities, and indices; floats for measurements, scientific calculations, and continuous values; strings for text processing and user interfaces; and booleans for flags, conditions, and logical operations. They should be able to justify their choice of data type based on the problem requirements.*

**3.2 Know how to convert between different data types**

**3.2.1 Convert to and from integer type**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the int() constructor to convert values to integers. They should understand how to convert floats (truncating the decimal part), strings containing numeric characters, and booleans (True → 1, False → 0) to integers. They should be able to handle common errors such as converting non-numeric strings (ValueError) and understand how to use try-except blocks to handle such errors. Students should also be able to convert integers to other types using str(), float(), and bool().*

**3.2.2 Convert to and from floating-point type**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the float() constructor to convert values to floating-point numbers. They should understand how to convert integers (preserving the value but changing the type), strings containing numeric characters (including scientific notation), and booleans (True → 1.0, False → 0.0) to floats. They should be able to handle common errors such as converting non-numeric strings and understand precision issues that may arise during conversion. Students should also be able to convert floats to other types using int(), str(), and bool().*

**3.2.3 Convert to and from string type**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the str() constructor to convert values to strings. They should understand how to convert integers, floats, booleans (True → "True", False → "False"), and other basic types to their string representations. Students should be able to use string methods to convert case (upper(), lower()), format strings (format(), f-strings), and join sequences of strings (join()). They should also be able to convert strings to other types using int(), float(), bool(), and list().*

**3.2.4 Convert to and from boolean type**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the bool() constructor to convert values to booleans. They should understand Python's truth value testing: which values are considered falsy (None, False, zero of any numeric type, empty sequences and collections) and which are truthy (most other values). Students should be able to explicitly convert values to booleans and understand implicit boolean conversion in contexts like if statements and while loops. They should also be able to convert booleans to other types using int(), float(), and str().*

**3.2.5 Handle conversion errors and edge cases**
*Guidance: Students should be able to identify and handle common errors in type conversion, such as ValueError when converting non-numeric strings to numbers, and OverflowError when converting values outside the representable range. They should understand how to use try-except blocks to handle these errors gracefully and how to validate input before conversion. Students should also be aware of edge cases, such as converting None to different types and the behavior of special floating-point values in conversions.*

**3.3 Be able to use type checking and type hints**

**3.3.1 Check the type of variables and objects**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the type() function to determine the type of a variable or object. They should understand how to compare types using type(x) is SomeType and isinstance(x, SomeType). Students should be able to explain the difference between these two approaches: type() checks for exact type matches, while isinstance() also considers inheritance. They should be able to use these functions in conditional statements to control program flow based on data types.*

**3.3.2 Use type hints in function definitions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to add type hints to function parameters and return values using the syntax def function_name(param: type) -> return_type:. They should understand basic type hints for built-in types (int, float, str, bool) and how to use None for return types when a function doesn't return a value. Students should be able to read and interpret function signatures with type hints and understand that type hints are primarily for documentation and static analysis, not runtime enforcement.*

**3.3.3 Use type hints for variables**
*Guidance: Students should be able to add type hints to variable declarations using the syntax variable_name: type = value. They should understand how this improves code readability and enables better IDE support. Students should be able to use type hints with initializations and in contexts where the type checker needs additional information. They should also understand that variable type hints are optional and don't affect runtime behavior.*

**3.3.4 Import and use types from the typing module**
*Guidance: Students should be able to import and use common types from the typing module, such as List, Dict, Tuple, Set, Optional, and Union. They should understand how to use these types in type hints for more complex data structures. For example, students should be able to write type hints like def process_items(items: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int]:. They should understand the purpose of these more specific type hints in improving code documentation and enabling better static analysis.*

**3.3.5 Understand the benefits and limitations of type hints**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain the benefits of type hints, including improved code documentation, better IDE support (autocompletion, error detection), and the ability to use static type checkers like mypy. They should also understand the limitations, such as the fact that type hints are not enforced at runtime in standard Python, the potential for increased code verbosity, and the learning curve for complex type hints. Students should be able to make informed decisions about when and how to use type hints in their code.*

**3.4 Understand the concept of mutability and immutability**

**3.4.1 Define mutability and immutability**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that mutability refers to an object's ability to be changed after creation, while immutability means an object cannot be changed after creation. They should understand that in Python, some objects (like lists, dictionaries, and sets) are mutable, while others (like integers, floats, strings, and tuples) are immutable. Students should be able to identify which basic data types are mutable and which are immutable.*

**3.4.2 Understand the implications of immutability**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that operations on immutable objects (like integers, floats, strings, and tuples) create new objects rather than modifying existing ones. They should understand how this affects memory usage and performance, especially in operations that appear to modify immutable objects (e.g., string concatenation). Students should be able to demonstrate that immutable objects cannot be changed in-place and that operations that appear to modify them actually return new objects.*

**3.4.3 Understand the implications of mutability**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that operations on mutable objects (like lists, dictionaries, and sets) modify the objects in-place. They should understand how this can lead to side effects when multiple variables reference the same mutable object. Students should be able to demonstrate that changes to a mutable object are visible through all references to that object, and understand concepts like aliasing and shallow copying.*

**3.4.4 Identify common pitfalls with mutable objects**
*Guidance: Students should be able to identify and avoid common pitfalls with mutable objects, such as unexpected aliasing, modifying default arguments that are mutable, and issues with mutable objects as dictionary keys. They should understand why mutable objects cannot be used as dictionary keys or elements in sets, and how to work around these limitations. Students should be able to recognize code that may have unintended side effects due to mutability.*

**3.4.5 Apply appropriate strategies for working with mutable and immutable objects**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply strategies for working effectively with both mutable and immutable objects. For immutable objects, they should understand when to use operations that create new objects and how to minimize unnecessary object creation. For mutable objects, they should understand when to create copies (shallow vs. deep) to avoid unintended side effects, and when to leverage mutability for efficiency. Students should be able to choose the appropriate type (mutable or immutable) based on the requirements of their program.*



#### Topic 4: Basic Operators
Students will be assessed on their ability to:

**4.1 Understand and use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)**

**4.1.1 Define and use addition and subtraction operators**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the addition operator (+) to add two or more numeric values (integers or floats) and concatenate strings. They should understand that addition is commutative (a + b = b + a) for numbers but not necessarily for other types. Students should be able to use the subtraction operator (-) to subtract one numeric value from another and understand that subtraction is not commutative (a - b ≠ b - a). They should be able to handle cases involving positive and negative numbers, and understand how these operators behave with different data types.*

**4.1.2 Define and use multiplication and division operators**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the multiplication operator (*) to multiply two or more numeric values and to repeat strings (e.g., "hi" * 3 = "hihihi"). They should understand that multiplication is commutative for numbers (a * b = b * a). Students should be able to use the division operator (/) to divide one numeric value by another, understanding that division by zero raises a ZeroDivisionError. They should understand that division of integers in Python 3 always returns a float, even when the result is a whole number (e.g., 4 / 2 = 2.0). Students should be able to handle cases with positive and negative numbers, and understand how these operators behave with different data types.*

**4.1.3 Define and use floor division and modulus operators**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the floor division operator (//) to perform division that rounds down to the nearest integer. They should understand that floor division of positive numbers truncates toward zero (e.g., 7 // 3 = 2), while floor division of negative numbers truncates toward negative infinity (e.g., -7 // 3 = -3). Students should be able to use the modulus operator (%) to calculate the remainder of a division operation. They should understand that the sign of the result from the modulus operator follows the divisor in Python (e.g., 7 % 3 = 1, -7 % 3 = 2, 7 % -3 = -2, -7 % -3 = -1). Students should be able to apply these operators in practical scenarios, such as determining if a number is even or odd (n % 2 == 0) or converting total minutes to hours and minutes.*

**4.1.4 Define and use exponentiation operator**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the exponentiation operator (**) to raise a number to a power. They should understand that exponentiation is not commutative (a ** b ≠ b ** a, except in special cases). Students should be able to handle cases with positive and negative exponents, fractional exponents (roots), and understand that raising a negative number to a fractional exponent may result in a complex number. They should be able to apply exponentiation in practical scenarios, such as calculating compound interest or areas and volumes. Students should also understand the difference between the exponentiation operator (**) and the built-in pow() function.*

**4.1.5 Understand operator precedence and associativity**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain the concept of operator precedence, which determines the order in which operations are performed in an expression with multiple operators. They should understand the standard precedence in Python: parentheses take precedence, followed by exponentiation, then multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus (at the same level), and finally addition and subtraction (at the same level). Students should be able to use parentheses to override the default precedence. They should also understand associativity, which determines the order of operations when operators have the same precedence (e.g., exponentiation is right-associative: 2 ** 3 ** 2 = 2 ** (3 ** 2) = 512, while arithmetic operators like addition and multiplication are left-associative: 10 - 5 - 2 = (10 - 5) - 2 = 3).*

**4.1.6 Apply arithmetic operators to different data types**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply arithmetic operators to different data types and understand the results. They should understand how arithmetic operations work between integers and floats (result is a float), between numbers and strings (only multiplication is defined), and between strings and other strings (only addition is defined). Students should be able to handle type errors when operations are not defined between certain types (e.g., adding a string and an integer without explicit conversion). They should also understand how arithmetic operators interact with boolean values (True is treated as 1, False as 0).*

**4.2 Understand and use comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)**

**4.2.1 Define and use equality and inequality operators**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the equality operator (==) to check if two values are equal and the inequality operator (!=) to check if two values are not equal. They should understand that these operators return boolean values (True or False). Students should be able to distinguish between equality (==) and identity (is) comparisons, understanding that equality checks if two objects have the same value, while identity checks if two variables refer to the same object. They should be able to handle comparisons between different data types, understanding that different types are generally not equal (e.g., 1 == "1" is False). Students should also understand how these operators work with complex objects like lists and dictionaries.*

**4.2.2 Define and use less than and greater than operators**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the less than operator (<) and greater than operator (>) to compare numerical values, understanding that these operators return boolean values. They should be able to handle comparisons between integers and floats, understanding that the values are compared numerically. Students should also be able to use these operators with strings, understanding that string comparison is lexicographical (based on Unicode code points of the characters). They should understand how these operators work with other sequence types like lists and tuples, which are compared element-wise.*

**4.2.3 Define and use less than or equal to and greater than or equal to operators**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the less than or equal to operator (<=) and greater than or equal to operator (>=) to compare numerical values, understanding that these operators return boolean values. They should understand that these operators are equivalent to (a < b or a == b) and (a > b or a == b) respectively, but are more efficient and concise. Students should be able to handle comparisons between different numeric types and understand how these operators work with strings and other sequence types. They should also understand how these operators handle special floating-point values like NaN (not a number), where comparisons always return False except for !=.*

**4.2.4 Understand comparison between different data types**
*Guidance: Students should be able to understand how comparison operators work between different data types. They should know that in Python 3, comparisons between different types (e.g., comparing a string with a number) generally raise a TypeError, unlike in Python 2 where such comparisons were allowed. Students should understand how numeric types are compared (integers and floats are compared numerically), and how sequences of the same type are compared (element-wise). They should be able to handle comparisons between numeric types and boolean values, understanding that True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in numeric contexts.*

**4.2.5 Use comparison operators in conditional statements**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use comparison operators effectively in conditional statements (if, elif, else) and loops (while, for). They should understand how to construct conditions that control program flow based on comparisons. Students should be able to write compound conditions using comparison operators and logical operators (and, or, not). They should also understand how to use comparison operators in list comprehensions and generator expressions to filter elements based on conditions.*

**4.2.6 Understand chained comparisons**
*Guidance: Students should be able to write and understand chained comparisons, such as a < b < c, which is equivalent to (a < b) and (b < c) but is more efficient and readable. They should understand that chained comparisons can include different comparison operators, such as a <= b != c. Students should be able to evaluate chained comparisons correctly, understanding that each comparison is evaluated from left to right, and the entire expression is True only if all individual comparisons are True. They should be able to use chained comparisons in practical scenarios, such as checking if a value is within a range (0 <= x < 100).*

**4.3 Understand and use logical operators (and, or, not)**

**4.3.1 Define and use the logical AND operator**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the logical AND operator (and) to combine two or more conditions, understanding that the result is True only if all conditions are True. They should be able to construct compound conditions using the and operator in conditional statements and loops. Students should understand the truth table for the and operator: True and True = True, True and False = False, False and True = False, False and False = False. They should be able to use the and operator in practical scenarios, such as checking multiple conditions before performing an action.*

**4.3.2 Define and use the logical OR operator**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the logical OR operator (or) to combine two or more conditions, understanding that the result is True if at least one condition is True. They should be able to construct compound conditions using the or operator in conditional statements and loops. Students should understand the truth table for the or operator: True or True = True, True or False = True, False or True = True, False or False = False. They should be able to use the or operator in practical scenarios, such as checking if any of several conditions is met before performing an action.*

**4.3.3 Define and use the logical NOT operator**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the logical NOT operator (not) to negate a condition, understanding that the result is True if the condition is False, and False if the condition is True. They should be able to use the not operator in conditional statements and loops to reverse the logic of a condition.

They should be able to use the not operator in practical scenarios, such as checking if a condition is not met before performing an action.*

**4.3.4 Understand short-circuit evaluation**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain short-circuit evaluation, where the second operand is not evaluated if the result can be determined from the first operand. They should understand that for the and operator, if the first operand is False, the result is False regardless of the second operand, so the second operand is not evaluated. For the or operator, if the first operand is True, the result is True regardless of the second operand, so the second operand is not evaluated. Students should be able to leverage short-circuit evaluation for efficiency and to prevent errors, such as checking if an object exists before accessing its attributes (if obj is not None and obj.value > 0:).*

**4.3.5 Combine logical operators in complex expressions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to combine logical operators (and, or, not) to create complex expressions.

They should understand that assignment is a statement, not an expression, and does not return a value (unlike in some other languages). Students should be able to use assignment in various contexts, including variable initialization, reassignment, and assignment of the result of expressions.*

**4.4.2 Define and use augmented assignment operators for arithmetic operations**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use augmented assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=) to perform an arithmetic operation and assignment in one step. They should understand that x op= y is equivalent to x = x op y, but may be more efficient as it can avoid creating a new object. Students should be able to use these operators with different data types, understanding how they behave with mutable and immutable objects. They should be able to explain that for immutable objects (like integers, floats, strings), augmented assignment creates a new object, while for mutable objects (like lists), it may modify the object in-place.*

**4.4.3 Understand the difference between assignment and equality**
*Guidance: Students should be able to clearly distinguish between assignment (=) and equality comparison (==). They should understand that assignment is used to bind a name to a value, while equality comparison is used to check if two values are equal. Students should be able to identify and correct common mistakes, such as using = instead of == in conditional statements. They should understand that assignment is a statement that does not return a value, while equality comparison is an expression that returns a boolean value.*

**4.4.4 Apply assignment operators with different data types**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply assignment operators with different data types and understand the behavior. They should understand how assignment works with immutable types (integers, floats, strings, tuples) versus mutable types (lists, dictionaries, sets). Students should be able to use augmented assignment operators with different types, understanding how the behavior differs (e.g., list += [1, 2, 3] modifies the list in-place, while string += "abc" creates a new string). They should also understand how assignment works with object references and the implications for mutable objects.*

**4.4.5 Understand operator precedence with assignment**
*Guidance: Students should be able to understand operator precedence when assignment is combined with other operators. They should know that assignment has lower precedence than most other operators, which means that expressions like x = a + b are evaluated as x = (a + b). Students should be able to use parentheses to override the default precedence when needed. They should also understand the behavior of assignment in complex expressions and how it affects the evaluation order.*

**4.4.6 Use assignment expressions (walrus operator :=)**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use assignment expressions (walrus operator :=) introduced in Python 3.8 to assign values to variables as part of an expression. They should understand that assignment expressions allow you to assign values to variables within expressions, which can be useful in situations like if statements, while loops, and list comprehensions. Students should be able to distinguish between assignment expressions (:=) and equality comparisons (==) and assignment statements (=). They should be able to use assignment expressions in practical scenarios, such as if (n := len(my_list)) > 10: or while (line := file.readline()) != '':.*

Students should be able to create nested functions that use variables from the enclosing scope and understand how these variables are preserved. They should understand how closures can be used to create functions with state or to implement data hiding. Students should be able to identify scenarios where nested functions and closures are useful and how to implement them correctly.*

**3.4.7 Identify and correct common scope-related errors**
*Guidance: Students should be able to identify and correct common errors related to variable scope, such as UnboundLocalError (trying to access a local variable before it's assigned), NameError (trying to access a variable that doesn't exist in the current scope), and errors related to modifying global variables without the global keyword. They should understand how to debug scope-related errors by checking variable definitions, assignments, and accesses. Students should be able to use print statements or debugging tools to verify the values and scopes of variables. They should understand common pitfalls such as unintentionally creating local variables when trying to modify global variables, or relying on variables that may not exist in all execution paths.*

#### Topic 4: Functions II: Advanced Concepts
Students will be assessed on their ability to:

**4.1 Understand positional and keyword arguments**

**4.1.1 Differentiate between positional and keyword arguments**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain the fundamental difference between positional and keyword arguments. They should understand that positional arguments are identified by their position in the function call, while keyword arguments are identified by the parameter name explicitly specified in the call. Students should be able to identify examples of each type in code and understand how Python processes them differently. They should recognize that positional arguments must appear before keyword arguments in a function call and that the order of positional arguments matters, while the order of keyword arguments does not.*

**4.1.2 Use positional arguments effectively**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use positional arguments in function calls by providing values in the same order as the parameters in the function definition. They should understand how to match arguments to parameters based on position and ensure the correct number of arguments is provided. Students should be able to identify scenarios where positional arguments are most appropriate, such as when the order of parameters is logical and well-established. They should understand the limitations of positional arguments, such as the need to remember the correct order and the inability to skip optional parameters. Students should be able to write function calls using positional arguments and trace how values are assigned to parameters.*

**4.1.3 Use keyword arguments effectively**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use keyword arguments in function calls by explicitly specifying the parameter name and value. They should understand the syntax `parameter_name=value` for keyword arguments and how this improves code readability by making the purpose of each argument explicit. Students should be able to use keyword arguments in any order, understanding that Python matches them to parameters by name rather than position. They should recognize scenarios where keyword arguments are particularly useful, such as when a function has many parameters, when only some optional parameters need to be specified, or when the order of parameters is not intuitive. Students should be able to write function calls using keyword arguments and understand how they are processed.*

**4.1.4 Combine positional and keyword arguments**
*Guidance: Students should be able to combine positional and keyword arguments in a single function call, understanding that all positional arguments must come before any keyword arguments. They should be able to determine which arguments to pass as positional and which as keyword based on the function's design and the specific use case. Students should understand how Python processes the combined arguments, first assigning positional arguments to parameters in order, then assigning keyword arguments to the remaining parameters by name. They should be able to identify and correct errors in mixed argument calls, such as providing duplicate values for the same parameter or placing keyword arguments before positional arguments.*

**4.1.5 Understand argument unpacking**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use argument unpacking to pass elements of iterables as positional arguments using the * operator, such as `function(*iterable)`. They should understand how to unpack dictionaries as keyword arguments using the ** operator, such as `function(**dictionary)`. Students should be able to combine unpacked arguments with regular arguments in function calls and understand the order in which they are processed. They should recognize scenarios where argument unpacking is useful, such as when the arguments are already stored in a data structure or when building function calls dynamically. Students should be able to identify and correct errors in argument unpacking, such as unpacking non-iterable objects or providing duplicate arguments.*

**4.1.6 Apply best practices for argument usage**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for using positional and keyword arguments to create clear, maintainable function interfaces. They should understand when to prefer positional arguments (for required parameters with a clear logical order) and when to prefer keyword arguments (for optional parameters or when clarity is more important than brevity). Students should be able to design function signatures that use both types effectively, such as placing required parameters first as positional arguments and optional parameters later as keyword arguments with default values. They should understand how to document function parameters clearly to guide users on which arguments should be passed as positional versus keyword. Students should be able to evaluate existing function interfaces and suggest improvements based on best practices.*

**4.1.7 Debug argument-related errors**
*Guidance: Students should be able to identify and debug common errors related to positional and keyword arguments, such as TypeError for incorrect number of arguments, SyntaxError for invalid argument syntax, and errors related to argument ordering. They should understand how to read and interpret error messages related to function calls and arguments. Students should be able to use debugging techniques such as printing function signatures, checking argument types and values, and verifying the order of arguments. They should understand common pitfalls such as providing arguments in the wrong order, forgetting to provide required arguments, or providing duplicate values for the same parameter. Students should be able to fix argument-related errors and ensure functions are called correctly.*

**4.2 Know how to use default parameter values**

**4.2.1 Define functions with default parameter values**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define functions with default parameter values using the syntax `def function_name(param1=default_value1, param2=default_value2, ...):`. They should understand that default parameter values allow functions to be called with fewer arguments than defined in the function signature. Students should be able to choose appropriate default values for different types of parameters, considering the function's purpose and common use cases. They should understand how default parameters make functions more flexible and easier to use by providing sensible defaults that can be overridden when needed. Students should be able to write function definitions with default parameters and understand how they are processed during function calls.*

**4.2.2 Call functions with default parameters**
*Guidance: Students should be able to call functions that have default parameters in various ways: providing all arguments, omitting some arguments to use defaults, or using keyword arguments to override specific defaults. They should understand how Python determines which default values to use based on the arguments provided in the function call. Students should be able to predict the behavior of function calls with default parameters and trace how values are assigned to parameters. They should understand how to use keyword arguments to selectively override default values while using defaults for other parameters. Students should be able to write function calls that effectively leverage default parameter values.*

**4.2.3 Understand the evaluation time of default parameters**
*Guidance: Students should understand that default parameter values are evaluated only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. They should recognize the implications of this behavior, especially when using mutable objects like lists or dictionaries as default values. Students should be able to identify the common pitfall of using mutable default values, which can lead to unexpected behavior when the same mutable object is shared across multiple function calls. They should understand why this happens and be able to explain it with examples. Students should be able to trace the execution of functions with mutable default values and identify when shared state occurs.*

**4.2.4 Avoid pitfalls with mutable default arguments**
*Guidance: Students should be able to identify and avoid the common pitfall of using mutable objects (lists, dictionaries, sets) as default parameter values. They should understand the standard workaround for this issue: using None as the default value and creating the mutable object inside the function if the parameter is None. Students should be able to implement this pattern correctly, such as `def function_name(param=None): if param is None: param = []`. They should understand alternative approaches, such as using a sentinel value or a function attribute. Students should be able to recognize code that uses mutable default arguments incorrectly and fix it to avoid the shared state problem.*

**4.2.5 Design effective default parameter strategies**
*Guidance: Students should be able to design effective strategies for using default parameters in function design. They should understand how to choose which parameters should have default values based on the function's purpose and common use cases. Students should be able to order parameters effectively, typically placing parameters without default values first, followed by parameters with default values. They should understand how to choose appropriate default values that are sensible for most use cases but can be easily overridden when needed. Students should be able to design function interfaces that balance flexibility with simplicity, using default parameters to make functions easier to use while still allowing customization.*

**4.2.6 Use default parameters with different data types**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use default parameters with different data types, including immutable types (integers, floats, strings, tuples) and mutable types (lists, dictionaries, sets). They should understand how the behavior differs between immutable and mutable default values and when each is appropriate. Students should be able to use None as a default value and handle it appropriately within the function. They should understand how to use special values like empty strings, empty tuples, or zero as default values and when these are appropriate. Students should be able to write functions with default parameters of various types and handle them correctly within the function body.*

**4.2.7 Document default parameters effectively**
*Guidance: Students should be able to document default parameters effectively in function docstrings, clearly indicating which parameters have default values and what those values are. They should understand how to write clear documentation that explains the purpose of each parameter, its default value, and how changing it affects the function's behavior. Students should be able to use standard documentation formats for default parameters, such as the Google Style or NumPy style docstrings. They should understand the importance of documenting not just the default value but also the implications of using different values. Students should be able to write comprehensive documentation for functions with default parameters that helps users understand how to use the function effectively.*

**4.3 Be able to use variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs)**

**4.3.1 Define functions with *args for variable positional arguments**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define functions that accept any number of positional arguments using the *args syntax. They should understand that *args collects additional positional arguments into a tuple, allowing the function to work with a variable number of inputs. Students should be able to access and process the arguments in the args tuple within the function. They should understand how to combine *args with regular positional parameters, recognizing that *args must come after regular positional parameters in the function definition. Students should be able to write functions that use *args to handle variable numbers of positional arguments and process them appropriately.*

**4.3.2 Define functions with **kwargs for variable keyword arguments**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define functions that accept any number of keyword arguments using the **kwargs syntax. They should understand that **kwargs collects additional keyword arguments into a dictionary, where keys are the parameter names and values are the argument values. Students should be able to access and process the arguments in the kwargs dictionary within the function. They should understand how to combine **kwargs with regular parameters and *args, recognizing that **kwargs must come after *args in the function definition. Students should be able to write functions that use **kwargs to handle variable numbers of keyword arguments and process them appropriately.*

**4.3.3 Call functions with *args and **kwargs**
*Guidance: Students should be able to call functions using *args and **kwargs to unpack iterables and dictionaries into arguments. They should understand how to use *iterable to unpack elements of an iterable as positional arguments and **dictionary to unpack key-value pairs as keyword arguments. Students should be able to combine unpacked arguments with regular arguments in function calls, understanding the order in which they are processed. They should recognize scenarios where argument unpacking is useful, such as when arguments are stored in data structures or when building function calls dynamically. Students should be able to write function calls that effectively use *args and **kwargs for argument unpacking.*

**4.3.4 Combine regular parameters with *args and **kwargs**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define functions that combine regular parameters, *args, and **kwargs in a single function signature. They should understand the correct order for these components: regular positional parameters, *args, regular keyword parameters with default values, and finally **kwargs. Students should be able to trace how arguments are assigned to parameters in such functions, understanding how Python processes different types of arguments. They should be able to write functions that use this combination to provide flexible interfaces while still maintaining required parameters. Students should understand how to design function signatures that balance flexibility with clarity by combining these different parameter types effectively.*

**4.3.5 Process *args and **kwargs within functions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to process the arguments collected in *args and **kwargs within functions. They should be able to iterate over args to access positional arguments and perform operations on them. Students should be able to access and manipulate values in kwargs by key, including checking for the existence of specific keys and providing default values when keys are missing. They should understand how to validate and convert arguments in *args and **kwargs to ensure they meet the function's requirements. Students should be able to write functions that process variable arguments effectively, including filtering, transforming, or aggregating the arguments as needed.*

**4.3.6 Forward arguments with *args and **kwargs**
*Guidance: Students should be able to forward arguments from one function to another using *args and **kwargs. They should understand how to use *args and **kwargs in function calls to pass along all or some of the arguments received by the current function. Students should be able to use this technique to create wrapper functions that add functionality before or after calling another function. They should understand how to combine forwarded arguments with additional arguments in the function call. Students should be able to write functions that forward arguments effectively, including modifying, filtering, or augmenting the arguments before forwarding them.*

**4.3.7 Apply best practices for variable-length arguments**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for using *args and **kwargs in function design. They should understand when to use variable-length arguments versus other approaches, such as requiring specific parameters or using data structures as parameters. Students should be able to design functions that use *args and **kwargs judiciously, balancing flexibility with clarity and maintainability. They should understand how to document functions with variable-length arguments clearly, indicating what kinds of arguments are expected and how they will be processed. Students should be able to identify and avoid common pitfalls, such as excessive use of variable-length arguments that makes code harder to understand or debug. They should be able to evaluate existing function designs and suggest improvements based on best practices.*

**4.4 Understand lambda functions and their uses**

**4.4.1 Define basic lambda functions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define basic lambda functions using the syntax `lambda arguments: expression`. They should understand that lambda functions are anonymous functions that can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Students should be able to write simple lambda functions that perform basic operations, such as arithmetic calculations, string operations, or conditional expressions. They should understand how lambda functions differ from regular functions defined with def, including their anonymous nature and the limitation to a single expression. Students should be able to trace the execution of lambda functions and understand how they return the result of evaluating their expression.*

**4.4.2 Use lambda functions with built-in functions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use lambda functions with built-in functions that accept functions as arguments, such as map(), filter(), sorted(), and reduce(). They should understand how to provide lambda functions as arguments to these built-in functions to customize their behavior. Students should be able to write lambda functions that work effectively with map() to transform elements of a sequence, with filter() to select elements that meet certain criteria, and with sorted() to specify custom sorting keys. They should understand how lambda functions provide a concise way to define simple functions for these use cases without needing to define separate named functions.*

**4.4.3 Use lambda functions with higher-order functions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use lambda functions with higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They should understand how to pass lambda functions as arguments to higher-order functions to customize their behavior. Students should be able to write higher-order functions that accept lambda functions and use them appropriately. They should understand how lambda functions can be used to create closures that capture variables from the enclosing scope. Students should be able to write code that uses lambda functions effectively with higher-order functions to create flexible and reusable components.*

**4.4.4 Compare lambda functions with regular functions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to compare lambda functions with regular functions defined with def, understanding the advantages and limitations of each approach. They should understand that lambda functions are limited to a single expression and cannot contain statements, while regular functions can contain multiple statements and more complex logic. Students should be able to identify scenarios where lambda functions are appropriate (simple, one-off functions) and scenarios where regular functions are more suitable (complex logic, reusable functions). They should understand the readability implications of using lambda functions versus regular functions. Students should be able to make informed decisions about when to use lambda functions versus regular functions based on the specific requirements of their code.*

**4.4.5 Use lambda functions for sorting and custom operations**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use lambda functions to specify custom sorting keys and operations. They should understand how to use lambda functions with the key parameter of sorted(), list.sort(), max(), min(), and other functions that accept key functions. Students should be able to write lambda functions that extract specific attributes or perform calculations on elements to determine their sort order or comparison value. They should understand how to use lambda functions with functions like itertools.groupby() to group elements based on custom criteria. Students should be able to write code that uses lambda functions effectively for sorting and custom operations on data.*

**4.4.6 Understand limitations and common pitfalls of lambda functions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to identify the limitations of lambda functions and common pitfalls associated with their use. They should understand that lambda functions are limited to a single expression and cannot contain statements, assignments, or multiple expressions. Students should be able to recognize when lambda functions become too complex and would be better expressed as regular functions. They should understand the debugging challenges associated with lambda functions, such as difficulty in setting breakpoints or inspecting their state. Students should be able to identify common pitfalls, such as using lambda functions for complex logic that would be more readable as regular functions, or overusing lambda functions when named functions would be more maintainable.*

**4.4.7 Apply best practices for lambda functions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for using lambda functions effectively and appropriately. They should understand that lambda functions are best used for simple, one-off functions that don't need to be reused elsewhere in the code. Students should be able to keep lambda functions concise and readable, avoiding complex expressions that would be better expressed as regular functions. They should understand how to document lambda functions when necessary, such as by adding comments or using descriptive variable names. Students should be able to evaluate existing code that uses lambda functions and suggest improvements based on best practices. They should understand when to prefer lambda functions and when to use regular functions based on the specific requirements of their code.*

### P3.3 Unit Content

#### Topic 1: Lists
Students will be assessed on their ability to:

**1.1 Understand how to create, access, and modify lists**

**1.1.1 Create lists using different methods**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create lists using various methods, including using square brackets with elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), using the list() constructor (e.g., `list((1, 2, 3))`), and using list comprehensions. They should understand how to create empty lists using either `[]` or `list()`. Students should be able to create lists containing different data types, including mixed types within a single list. They should understand that lists are ordered collections and that the order of elements is preserved when lists are created. Students should be able to create lists with duplicate elements and understand that lists allow duplicates.*

**1.1.2 Access list elements using indexing**
*Guidance: Students should be able to access individual elements in a list using indexing with square brackets (e.g., `my_list[0]`). They should understand that Python uses zero-based indexing, where the first element has index 0. Students should be able to access elements from the end of a list using negative indices (e.g., `my_list[-1]` for the last element). They should understand how to calculate valid index ranges for a list of a given length and be able to identify when an index will cause an IndexError. Students should be able to use variables as indices and understand how to validate indices before accessing list elements.*

**1.1.3 Access list slices using slicing**
*Guidance: Students should be able to access sublists (slices) of a list using slicing syntax (e.g., `my_list[start:stop:step]`). They should understand how to specify start, stop, and step parameters, including default values when these parameters are omitted. Students should be able to use slicing to create new lists containing subsets of elements from the original list. They should understand how to use negative indices in slices and how to reverse a list using slicing (e.g., `my_list[::-1]`). Students should be able to predict the result of slicing operations and understand that slicing creates a new list rather than modifying the original.*

**1.1.4 Modify list elements by assignment**
*Guidance: Students should be able to modify individual elements in a list by assigning new values to specific indices (e.g., `my_list[0] = new_value`). They should understand that this operation changes the original list rather than creating a new one. Students should be able to modify elements using both positive and negative indices. They should understand how to validate indices before assignment to avoid IndexError. Students should be able to modify elements with values of different data types, understanding that lists can contain mixed types. They should be able to trace the state of a list before and after element modification operations.*

**1.1.5 Modify list slices by assignment**
*Guidance: Students should be able to modify sublists (slices) of a list by assigning new values to slice ranges (e.g., `my_list[1:3] = [4, 5]`). They should understand that the assigned value can be a single element, a list of elements, or any iterable. Students should be able to use slice assignment to replace, insert, or delete multiple elements at once. They should understand how the length of the assigned value affects the list (e.g., assigning a longer list increases the list size, assigning a shorter list decreases it). Students should be able to use slice assignment with step values to replace non-consecutive elements. They should be able to predict the result of slice assignment operations and understand how they modify the original list.*

**1.1.6 Understand list mutability**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that lists are mutable objects, meaning their contents can be changed after creation. They should understand how this differs from immutable objects like strings and tuples. Students should be able to identify operations that modify a list in-place versus those that create a new list. They should understand the implications of list mutability when lists are passed as arguments to functions or assigned to multiple variables. Students should be able to demonstrate that multiple variables can reference the same list object and how modifications through one variable affect all references. They should understand the concept of object identity in Python and how to use the id() function to verify that two variables reference the same list object.*

**1.1.7 Copy lists to avoid unintended modifications**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create copies of lists to avoid unintended modifications when working with multiple references. They should understand the difference between shallow copy (e.g., `my_list.copy()`, `my_list[:]`, `list(my_list)`) and deep copy (e.g., `copy.deepcopy(my_list)`). Students should be able to identify scenarios where shallow copy is sufficient and where deep copy is necessary (e.g., when lists contain nested mutable objects). They should understand how to verify that two variables reference different list objects using the id() function or the is operator. Students should be able to choose the appropriate copying method based on the structure of the list and the requirements of the program.*

**1.2 Know how to use list methods (append, insert, remove, pop, etc.)**

**1.2.1 Use append() to add elements to the end of a list**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the append() method to add a single element to the end of a list (e.g., `my_list.append(element)`). They should understand that append() modifies the list in-place and returns None. Students should be able to use append() with elements of any data type, including other lists (which will be added as a nested list). They should understand the time complexity of append() as O(1) on average, making it efficient for building lists incrementally. Students should be able to trace the state of a list before and after append operations and understand how append() affects the list's length. They should be able to use append() in loops to build lists dynamically.*

**1.2.2 Use insert() to add elements at specific positions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the insert() method to add an element at a specific position in a list (e.g., `my_list.insert(index, element)`). They should understand that insert() modifies the list in-place and returns None. Students should be able to use insert() with valid indices (0 to len(my_list)) and understand how elements at and after the insertion point are shifted to make room. They should understand the time complexity of insert() as O(n) in the worst case, where n is the length of the list, making it less efficient than append() for large lists. Students should be able to use insert() with negative indices and understand how they are interpreted relative to the end of the list. They should be able to trace the state of a list before and after insert operations.*

**1.2.3 Use extend() to add multiple elements to a list**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the extend() method to add multiple elements to the end of a list (e.g., `my_list.extend(iterable)`). They should understand that extend() modifies the list in-place and returns None. Students should be able to use extend() with any iterable object, including lists, tuples, strings, and generators. They should understand the difference between extend() and append() when adding lists (extend() adds each element individually, while append() adds the entire list as a single nested element). Students should understand the time complexity of extend() as O(k), where k is the length of the iterable, making it efficient for adding multiple elements. Students should be able to trace the state of a list before and after extend operations.*

**1.2.4 Use remove() to remove specific elements by value**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the remove() method to remove the first occurrence of a specific value from a list (e.g., `my_list.remove(value)`). They should understand that remove() modifies the list in-place and returns None. Students should be able to handle cases where the value is not in the list, which raises a ValueError, and use techniques like checking if the value exists before removal or using try-except blocks. They should understand that remove() only removes the first occurrence of the value and leaves any subsequent occurrences unchanged. Students should understand the time complexity of remove() as O(n), where n is the length of the list, as it may need to search through the entire list. Students should be able to trace the state of a list before and after remove operations.*

**1.2.5 Use pop() to remove and return elements by index**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the pop() method to remove and return an element at a specific index (e.g., `my_list.pop(index)`). They should understand that pop() modifies the list in-place and returns the removed element. Students should be able to use pop() without arguments to remove and return the last element of the list. They should be able to handle cases where the index is out of range, which raises an IndexError, and use techniques like validating the index before removal or using try-except blocks. Students should understand the time complexity of pop() as O(1) for the last element and O(n) for other elements, where n is the length of the list, as elements after the popped index need to be shifted. Students should be able to trace the state of a list before and after pop operations and use the returned value.*

**1.2.6 Use clear() to remove all elements from a list**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the clear() method to remove all elements from a list (e.g., `my_list.clear()`). They should understand that clear() modifies the list in-place and returns None. Students should be able to distinguish between clear() and creating a new empty list, understanding that clear() affects all references to the same list object. They should understand the time complexity of clear() as O(1) in most Python implementations, as it typically involves releasing the internal buffer of the list. Students should be able to trace the state of a list before and after clear operations and understand how it affects the list's length. They should be able to use clear() when they need to reuse a list object but remove all its current elements.*

**1.2.7 Use methods for searching and counting elements**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use methods like index() to find the position of an element (e.g., `my_list.index(value)`), count() to count occurrences of an element (e.g., `my_list.count(value)`), and the in operator to check for element membership (e.g., `value in my_list`). They should understand how index() returns the first occurrence of the value and raises a ValueError if the value is not found. Students should be able to use optional parameters with index() to specify a search range. They should understand how count() returns the number of occurrences of the value in the list. Students should be able to use these methods effectively for searching and counting operations and understand their time complexities (O(n) for both index() and count()).*

**1.2.8 Use methods for sorting and reversing lists**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use methods like sort() to sort a list in-place (e.g., `my_list.sort()`) and reverse() to reverse a list in-place (e.g., `my_list.reverse()`). They should understand that these methods modify the list in-place and return None. Students should be able to use optional parameters with sort() such as reverse=True for descending order and key=function to specify a custom sorting key. They should understand the difference between in-place sorting with sort() and creating a new sorted list with the sorted() function. Students should understand the time complexity of sort() as O(n log n) for most cases, making it efficient for sorting large lists. They should be able to trace the state of a list before and after sorting and reversing operations.*

**1.3 Be able to use list comprehensions**

**1.3.1 Create basic list comprehensions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create basic list comprehensions using the syntax `[expression for item in iterable]`. They should understand that list comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing iterables. Students should be able to use list comprehensions to transform elements from an iterable (e.g., `[x*2 for x in range(5)]` to create `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`). They should understand how list comprehensions are evaluated, with the expression being applied to each item in the iterable in order. Students should be able to use list comprehensions with different types of iterables, including lists, tuples, strings, and ranges. They should understand how list comprehensions create new lists rather than modifying existing ones.*

**1.3.2 Use conditional expressions in list comprehensions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use conditional expressions in list comprehensions to filter elements using the syntax `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`. They should understand that the condition is evaluated for each item in the iterable, and only items for which the condition is True are included in the resulting list. Students should be able to use conditions with comparison operators, logical operators, and function calls. They should understand how to combine multiple conditions using logical operators. Students should be able to use conditional expressions to filter elements based on their values, types, or other properties. They should be able to trace the evaluation of conditional list comprehensions and predict the resulting lists.*

**1.3.3 Use if-else expressions in list comprehensions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use if-else expressions in list comprehensions to apply different transformations based on conditions using the syntax `[expression1 if condition else expression2 for item in iterable]`. They should understand that this syntax allows for conditional transformations rather than just filtering. Students should be able to distinguish between filtering with if conditions at the end and conditional transformations with if-else expressions in the middle. They should understand how if-else expressions are evaluated for each item in the iterable, with expression1 being used if the condition is True and expression2 being used if the condition is False. Students should be able to use if-else expressions to apply different transformations based on element properties.*

**1.3.4 Create nested list comprehensions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create nested list comprehensions to generate lists of lists or to flatten nested structures. They should understand the syntax for nested list comprehensions, such as `[[expression for inner_item in inner_iterable] for outer_item in outer_iterable]` for creating lists of lists. Students should be able to use nested list comprehensions to flatten nested structures, such as `[item for sublist in nested_list for item in sublist]`. They should understand how nested list comprehensions are evaluated, with the outer loop running first and the inner loop running for each iteration of the outer loop. Students should be able to trace the evaluation of nested list comprehensions and predict the resulting lists.*

**1.3.5 Use list comprehensions with different data types**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use list comprehensions with different data types, including numbers, strings, and custom objects. They should understand how to apply type-specific operations in list comprehensions, such as string methods or object attributes. Students should be able to use list comprehensions to convert between data types, such as converting strings to numbers or vice versa. They should understand how to handle type errors and exceptions in list comprehensions, such as using try-except blocks or filtering out invalid elements. Students should be able to use list comprehensions with mixed data types and apply appropriate transformations based on the type of each element.*

**1.3.6 Compare list comprehensions with traditional loops**
*Guidance: Students should be able to compare list comprehensions with traditional for loops for creating lists. They should understand the advantages of list comprehensions, including conciseness, readability for simple transformations, and potential performance benefits. Students should be able to identify scenarios where list comprehensions are appropriate (simple transformations and filtering) and scenarios where traditional loops are more suitable (complex logic, multiple statements, or when side effects are needed). They should understand how to convert between list comprehensions and equivalent for loops. Students should be able to evaluate the readability and maintainability of both approaches and choose the most appropriate one based on the specific requirements.*

**1.3.7 Apply best practices for list comprehensions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for writing clear and effective list comprehensions. They should understand the importance of keeping list comprehensions simple and readable, avoiding excessive complexity or nesting. Students should be able to use meaningful variable names in list comprehensions to improve readability. They should understand when to break complex list comprehensions into multiple steps or use traditional loops instead. Students should be able to use comments to explain complex list comprehensions when necessary. They should understand the performance implications of list comprehensions compared to other approaches and be able to choose the most efficient method for the specific use case.*

**1.4 Understand how to iterate over lists using loops**

**1.4.1 Iterate over list elements using basic for loops**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use basic for loops to iterate over list elements using the syntax `for element in my_list:`. They should understand how this approach provides direct access to each element in the list without needing to use indices. Students should be able to use this method to perform operations on each element, such as printing, transforming, or accumulating values. They should understand how the loop variable takes on each element of the list in sequence and how the loop continues until all elements have been processed. Students should be able to trace the execution of for loops and understand how the loop variable changes with each iteration.*

**1.4.2 Iterate over list elements using indices and range()**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use for loops with range() and len() to iterate over list elements using indices, using the syntax `for i in range(len(my_list)):` and accessing elements with `my_list[i]`. They should understand how this approach provides access to both the index and the element, which can be useful for certain operations. Students should be able to use this method when they need to know the position of elements in the list or when they need to modify elements in place. They should understand how range(len(my_list)) generates a sequence of indices from 0 to len(my_list)-1. Students should be able to trace the execution of these loops and understand how the index variable changes with each iteration.*

**1.4.3 Iterate over list elements using enumerate()**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the enumerate() function in for loops to iterate over list elements while keeping track of their indices, using the syntax `for index, element in enumerate(my_list):`. They should understand how enumerate() returns tuples of (index, element) pairs and how tuple unpacking allows direct access to both values. Students should be able to use enumerate() with an optional start parameter to specify a starting index other than 0. They should understand the advantages of using enumerate() over range(len()) for readability and conciseness. Students should be able to trace the execution of loops with enumerate() and understand how both the index and element variables change with each iteration.*

**1.4.4 Iterate over list elements using while loops**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use while loops to iterate over list elements by manually managing an index variable, using the syntax `i = 0 while i < len(my_list): # process my_list[i] i += 1`. They should understand how this approach provides more control over the iteration process, allowing for custom increment steps or conditional continuation. Students should be able to use while loops when they need more flexibility than for loops provide, such as when the iteration logic is complex or when they need to skip or repeat certain elements. They should understand the importance of properly updating the index variable to avoid infinite loops. Students should be able to trace the execution of while loops and understand how the index variable changes and when the loop terminates.*

**1.4.5 Iterate over multiple lists simultaneously**
*Guidance: Students should be able to iterate over multiple lists simultaneously using methods like zip() or manual index management. They should understand how to use zip() with the syntax `for elem1, elem2 in zip(list1, list2):` to iterate over corresponding elements of multiple lists. Students should understand how zip() handles lists of different lengths by stopping when the shortest list is exhausted. They should be able to use itertools.zip_longest() to iterate over lists of different lengths, specifying a fill value for missing elements. Students should also understand how to iterate over multiple lists using manual index management with while loops or range(). They should be able to choose the most appropriate method based on the specific requirements.*

**1.4.6 Modify list elements during iteration**
*Guidance: Students should be able to modify list elements during iteration using appropriate techniques. They should understand that modifying a list while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, such as skipping elements or causing index errors. Students should be able to use techniques like iterating over a copy of the list (e.g., `for element in my_list.copy():`) or iterating over indices (e.g., `for i in range(len(my_list)):`) when they need to modify the list. They should understand how to safely add, remove, or replace elements during iteration without causing issues. Students should be able to identify common pitfalls when modifying lists during iteration and use appropriate techniques to avoid them.*

**1.4.7 Use list iteration for common operations**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use list iteration to perform common operations such as filtering elements, transforming elements, accumulating values, and searching for elements. They should understand how to use loops to filter elements based on conditions, either by creating a new list with the filtered elements or by removing elements from the original list. Students should be able to use loops to transform elements by applying operations or functions to each element. They should understand how to use loops to accumulate values, such as calculating sums, products, or other aggregates. Students should be able to use loops to search for elements that meet specific criteria and either return the elements or their indices. They should be able to choose the most appropriate iteration method for each operation.*



#### Topic 2: Tuples
Students will be assessed on their ability to:

**2.1 Understand how to create and access tuples**

**2.1.1 Create tuples using parentheses**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create tuples using parentheses syntax (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`). They should understand that parentheses are the standard way to define tuples, though they can be created without parentheses in certain contexts (called "tuple packing"). Students should be able to create tuples containing elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, and even other tuples (nested tuples). They should understand that tuples preserve the order of elements and can contain duplicate values. Students should be able to create tuples with a single element by including a trailing comma (e.g., `(1,)`) to distinguish them from regular parenthesized expressions.*

**2.1.2 Create tuples using the tuple() constructor**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create tuples using the tuple() constructor. They should understand how to convert other iterables to tuples using this constructor, such as `tuple([1, 2, 3])` to convert a list to a tuple, or `tuple("hello")` to convert a string to a tuple of characters. Students should be able to create empty tuples using `tuple()`. They should understand that the tuple() constructor accepts any iterable object and creates a new tuple containing all elements of the iterable in order. Students should be able to predict the result of converting different types of iterables to tuples and understand how this differs from creating tuples with parentheses.*

**2.1.3 Create tuples without parentheses (tuple packing)**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create tuples without parentheses through tuple packing (e.g., `a = 1, 2, 3`). They should understand that when multiple expressions are separated by commas in a context that expects a single value, Python automatically packs them into a tuple. Students should be able to identify situations where tuple packing occurs, such as in assignment statements, function return statements, and function arguments. They should understand how tuple packing relates to tuple unpacking and how these two concepts work together. Students should be able to use tuple packing effectively in their code and understand when it is appropriate versus when to use explicit parentheses.*

**2.1.4 Access tuple elements using indexing**
*Guidance: Students should be able to access individual elements in a tuple using indexing with square brackets (e.g., `my_tuple[0]`). They should understand that Python uses zero-based indexing, where the first element has index 0. Students should be able to access elements from the end of a tuple using negative indices (e.g., `my_tuple[-1]` for the last element). They should understand how to calculate valid index ranges for a tuple of a given length and be able to identify when an index will cause an IndexError. Students should be able to use variables as indices and understand how to validate indices before accessing tuple elements. They should understand that indexing a tuple returns the element at the specified position and does not modify the tuple.*

**2.1.5 Access tuple slices using slicing**
*Guidance: Students should be able to access sub-tuples (slices) of a tuple using slicing syntax (e.g., `my_tuple[start:stop:step]`). They should understand how to specify start, stop, and step parameters, including default values when these parameters are omitted. Students should be able to use slicing to create new tuples containing subsets of elements from the original tuple. They should understand how to use negative indices in slices and how to reverse a tuple using slicing (e.g., `my_tuple[::-1]`). Students should be able to predict the result of slicing operations and understand that slicing creates a new tuple rather than modifying the original. They should understand how slicing behaves with edge cases, such as when start or stop indices are out of range.*

**2.1.6 Create and access nested tuples**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create tuples that contain other tuples as elements (nested tuples). They should understand how to access elements in nested tuples using multiple indexing operations (e.g., `my_tuple[0][1]` to access the second element of the first tuple within my_tuple). Students should be able to create tuples with multiple levels of nesting and navigate through them to access specific elements. They should understand how nested tuples preserve the structure of hierarchical data and can be used to represent complex relationships. Students should be able to use nested tuples in practical applications, such as representing coordinates, matrices, or tree structures. They should understand how to iterate over nested tuples using nested loops or comprehensions.*

**2.1.7 Create single-element and empty tuples**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create single-element tuples using the syntax `(element,)` with a trailing comma, which distinguishes them from regular parenthesized expressions. They should understand why the trailing comma is necessary and what happens if it is omitted (the expression is treated as a regular parenthesized value rather than a tuple). Students should be able to create empty tuples using either `()` or `tuple()`. They should understand the use cases for single-element and empty tuples, such as placeholders, return values, or as initial values that will be modified later. Students should be able to distinguish between single-element tuples and the element itself, understanding that they are different types with different properties and behaviors.*

**2.2 Know the differences between lists and tuples**

**2.2.1 Compare mutability of lists and tuples**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that lists are mutable (their contents can be changed after creation) while tuples are immutable (their contents cannot be changed after creation). They should understand the implications of this difference, such as how lists can be modified in-place using methods like append(), insert(), remove(), etc., while tuples do not have these methods. Students should be able to demonstrate that attempting to modify a tuple (e.g., by assigning to an index) raises a TypeError. They should understand how immutability makes tuples safer to use in certain contexts, such as when data integrity is important. Students should be able to explain why some operations that modify lists return new tuples instead (e.g., concatenation returns a new tuple rather than modifying the original).*

**2.2.2 Compare performance characteristics of lists and tuples**
*Guidance: Students should be able to compare the performance characteristics of lists and tuples, understanding that tuples are generally more memory-efficient and faster to access than lists. They should understand that tuples have a fixed memory layout determined at creation time, which allows for more efficient storage and access, while lists need extra memory to accommodate potential changes. Students should be able to explain that operations on tuples are generally faster than equivalent operations on lists due to this fixed memory layout. They should understand that tuples are optimized for operations that don't require modification, such as iteration and element access. Students should be able to identify scenarios where performance differences between lists and tuples might be significant, such as in performance-critical code or when working with large collections.*

**2.2.3 Compare available methods for lists and tuples**
*Guidance: Students should be able to compare the methods available for lists and tuples, understanding that lists have many methods for modification (e.g., append(), insert(), remove(), pop(), sort(), reverse()) while tuples have only a few methods that don't modify the tuple (e.g., count(), index()). They should understand that the methods available for each data type reflect their mutability: lists have methods that modify them in-place, while tuples only have methods that query or search them. Students should be able to identify which methods are available for each data type and explain why certain methods are missing from tuples. They should understand how to perform equivalent operations on tuples that would use modifying methods on lists, such as creating new tuples instead of modifying existing ones. Students should be able to choose the appropriate data type based on the operations needed.*

**2.2.4 Compare use cases for lists and tuples**
*Guidance: Students should be able to compare the typical use cases for lists and tuples, understanding when each is more appropriate. They should understand that lists are generally used for collections of items that need to be modified, such as when items need to be added, removed, or reordered. Students should be able to explain that tuples are generally used for collections of items that should not change, such as fixed coordinates, configuration settings, or dictionary keys. They should understand how tuples are often used to represent records or structured data where each position has a specific meaning. Students should be able to identify scenarios in their own code where lists or tuples would be more appropriate based on whether the data needs to be modified. They should understand how the choice between lists and tuples can affect code clarity, safety, and performance.*

**2.2.5 Compare memory usage of lists and tuples**
*Guidance: Students should be able to compare the memory usage of lists and tuples, understanding that tuples generally use less memory than equivalent lists. They should understand that tuples have a fixed memory layout determined at creation time, which allows for more efficient storage, while lists need extra memory to accommodate potential changes. Students should be able to explain how lists allocate extra memory (overallocation) to make append operations efficient, while tuples do not need this overallocation since they cannot be modified. They should understand how to measure the memory usage of lists and tuples using tools like sys.getsizeof(). Students should be able to identify scenarios where memory differences between lists and tuples might be significant, such as when working with large collections or in memory-constrained environments.*

**2.2.6 Convert between lists and tuples**
*Guidance: Students should be able to convert between lists and tuples using the list() and tuple() constructors. They should understand how to convert a list to a tuple using `tuple(my_list)` and a tuple to a list using `list(my_tuple)`. They should understand that these operations create new objects rather than modifying the original ones. Students should be able to explain when such conversions might be necessary, such as when needing to use a list as a dictionary key (which requires converting it to a tuple first) or when needing to modify a tuple (which requires converting it to a list first). They should understand the performance implications of these conversions, especially for large collections. Students should be able to use these conversions effectively in their code and understand how they affect the original objects.*

**2.2.7 Compare syntax and creation methods**
*Guidance: Students should be able to compare the syntax and creation methods for lists and tuples. They should understand that lists are created using square brackets `[1, 2, 3]` while tuples are typically created using parentheses `(1, 2, 3)`. Students should be able to explain the special cases in syntax, such as creating single-element tuples (which require a trailing comma) versus single-element lists (which do not). They should understand how to create empty lists (`[]` or `list()`) and empty tuples (`()` or `tuple()`). Students should be able to identify lists and tuples in code based on their syntax and explain why certain syntax choices were made. They should understand how the different syntaxes reflect the different purposes and behaviors of lists and tuples.*

**2.3 Be able to use tuple operations and methods**

**2.3.1 Use tuple concatenation**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the concatenation operator (+) to combine two or more tuples into a new tuple (e.g., `tuple1 + tuple2`). They should understand that concatenation creates a new tuple containing all elements of the original tuples in order and does not modify the original tuples. Students should be able to concatenate multiple tuples in a single expression and understand how the order of elements is preserved. They should understand the time complexity of tuple concatenation as O(n+m), where n and m are the lengths of the tuples being concatenated, and how this affects performance for large tuples. Students should be able to use tuple concatenation effectively in their code and understand when it is appropriate versus other methods of combining tuples.*

**2.3.2 Use tuple repetition**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the repetition operator (*) to create a new tuple by repeating an existing tuple a specified number of times (e.g., `tuple * n`). They should understand that repetition creates a new tuple containing the elements of the original tuple repeated n times and does not modify the original tuple. Students should be able to use repetition with both positive integers (which creates the repeated tuple) and zero (which creates an empty tuple). They should understand the behavior with negative integers (which also creates an empty tuple). Students should be able to predict the result of repetition operations and understand how the order of elements is preserved. They should be able to use tuple repetition effectively in scenarios such as creating initial values or patterns.*

**2.3.3 Use tuple comparison operations**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) to compare tuples. They should understand how tuple comparison works: elements are compared pairwise in order until a difference is found or one tuple runs out of elements. Students should be able to predict the result of comparing tuples of different lengths and tuples with different elements. They should understand how comparison with different data types works (e.g., comparing a tuple of integers with a tuple of strings). They should be able to use tuple comparison in conditional statements and sorting operations. Students should understand how tuple comparison differs from list comparison in terms of behavior but not in terms of the comparison mechanism itself.*

**2.3.4 Use tuple methods (count, index)**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the methods available for tuples: count() to count occurrences of a value (e.g., `my_tuple.count(value)`) and index() to find the position of a value (e.g., `my_tuple.index(value)`). They should understand that these methods do not modify the tuple but return information about it. Students should be able to use count() to count how many times a specific value appears in a tuple. They should be able to use index() to find the first occurrence of a value and handle cases where the value is not in the tuple (which raises a ValueError). They should understand how to use optional parameters with index() to specify a search range. Students should be able to explain why tuples have fewer methods than lists and how this reflects their immutability.*

**2.3.5 Use tuple unpacking**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use tuple unpacking to assign elements of a tuple to multiple variables in a single statement (e.g., `a, b, c = my_tuple`). They should understand that the number of variables on the left side must match the number of elements in the tuple. Students should be able to use extended unpacking with the * operator (e.g., `a, *b, c = my_tuple`) to assign some elements to individual variables and the remaining elements to a list. They should understand how tuple unpacking works in various contexts, such as in for loops, function returns, and multiple assignments. Students should be able to use tuple unpacking to swap values between variables without needing a temporary variable. They should understand how tuple unpacking can make code more readable and concise by avoiding explicit indexing.*

**2.3.6 Use tuples with built-in functions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use tuples with various built-in functions in Python. They should understand how to use functions like len() to get the length of a tuple, max() and min() to find the maximum and minimum values in a tuple, and sum() to calculate the sum of numeric elements in a tuple. Students should be able to use functions like sorted() to create a sorted list from a tuple (since tuples themselves cannot be sorted in-place). They should understand how to use functions like any() and all() with tuples to check if any or all elements meet a condition. Students should be able to use tuples with functions like enumerate() to iterate over both indices and elements. They should understand how these functions work with tuples and how the results differ from when used with lists.*

**2.3.7 Use tuples in operations that require immutable objects**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use tuples in operations that require immutable objects, such as dictionary keys or set elements. They should understand why lists cannot be used as dictionary keys or set elements (because they are mutable and hashable) and how tuples solve this problem. Students should be able to create dictionaries with tuple keys and perform operations on these dictionaries. They should be able to add tuples to sets and perform set operations on sets containing tuples. They should understand how the immutability of tuples makes them suitable for these operations, while the mutability of lists makes them unsuitable. Students should be able to identify scenarios in their own code where tuples would be more appropriate than lists for these reasons. They should understand how to use tuples effectively in contexts that require immutable objects.*

**2.4 Understand when to use tuples instead of lists**

**2.4.1 Use tuples for fixed collections**
*Guidance: Students should be able to identify scenarios where tuples are more appropriate than lists for representing fixed collections of data. They should understand that tuples are ideal when the collection should not change after creation, such as for constants, configuration settings, or fixed coordinates. Students should be able to explain how using tuples for fixed collections makes code more readable and self-documenting, as the immutability signals that the data is not meant to change. They should understand how tuples can prevent accidental modification of data that should remain constant. Students should be able to identify examples in their own code where tuples would be more appropriate than lists for fixed collections and implement them accordingly. They should understand how the use of tuples for fixed collections can improve code safety and clarity.*

**2.4.2 Use tuples as dictionary keys**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use tuples as keys in dictionaries, understanding that this is possible because tuples are immutable and hashable, while lists are not. They should understand how to create dictionaries with tuple keys and access values using these keys. Students should be able to explain why tuples make good dictionary keys when a composite key is needed (e.g., coordinates, multi-part identifiers). They should understand how to use tuples as keys in scenarios such as representing grid coordinates, multi-dimensional data, or complex identifiers. Students should be able to compare the use of tuples as keys with alternative approaches, such as using strings or custom objects, and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. They should be able to identify scenarios in their own code where tuples would be appropriate as dictionary keys.*

**2.4.3 Use tuples for function return values**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use tuples to return multiple values from functions, understanding that this is a common and idiomatic pattern in Python. They should understand how to return multiple values as a tuple (e.g., `return value1, value2, value3`) and how to unpack these values when calling the function (e.g., `a, b, c = function()`). Students should be able to explain how returning multiple values as a tuple is more efficient and clearer than using other approaches, such as modifying global variables or using mutable parameters. They should understand how to handle cases where only some of the returned values are needed (e.g., using `_` as a placeholder for unneeded values). Students should be able to identify scenarios in their own functions where returning multiple values as a tuple would be appropriate and implement this pattern effectively.*

**2.4.4 Use tuples for data integrity**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use tuples to ensure data integrity in scenarios where collections should not be modified. They should understand how the immutability of tuples prevents accidental or unauthorized modification of data, which can be important for security, consistency, and correctness. Students should be able to explain how tuples can be used to protect critical data that should remain constant throughout a program's execution. They should understand how tuples can be used in scenarios where data is passed between different parts of a program or between different modules, ensuring that the original data cannot be modified. Students should be able to identify scenarios in their own code where data integrity is important and use tuples appropriately to protect critical data. They should understand how the use of tuples for data integrity can improve program reliability and security.*

**2.4.5 Use tuples in set operations**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use tuples in set operations, understanding that tuples can be elements of sets because they are immutable and hashable, while lists cannot. They should understand how to create sets containing tuples and perform set operations such as union, intersection, and difference on these sets. Students should be able to explain how tuples in sets can be useful for scenarios such as eliminating duplicate records, checking membership, or performing set operations on composite data. They should understand how to use tuples in sets for scenarios such as tracking unique combinations of values, implementing graph algorithms, or solving combinatorial problems. Students should be able to identify scenarios in their own code where tuples in sets would be useful and implement them effectively. They should understand how the immutability of tuples makes them suitable for use in sets while lists are not.*

**2.4.6 Use tuples for performance-critical code**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use tuples in performance-critical code, understanding that tuples are generally more memory-efficient and faster to access than lists. They should understand how the fixed memory layout of tuples allows for more efficient storage and access compared to lists, which need extra memory to accommodate potential changes. Students should be able to identify scenarios where performance differences between lists and tuples might be significant, such as when working with large collections or in code that needs to run quickly. They should understand how to measure and compare the performance of lists and tuples in their own code using tools like timeit or profiling tools. Students should be able to make informed decisions about when to use tuples instead of lists based on performance considerations. They should understand how to balance performance with other factors such as code clarity and maintainability.*

**2.4.7 Apply best practices for tuple usage**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for using tuples effectively in their code. They should understand when to prefer tuples over lists based on factors such as immutability requirements, performance considerations, and code clarity. Students should be able to use meaningful variable names for tuples and document their purpose when necessary. They should understand how to use tuple unpacking effectively to make code more readable and avoid excessive indexing. They should be able to choose appropriate data structures for their specific use cases, understanding the trade-offs between tuples and other collection types. Students should be able to identify and avoid common pitfalls when using tuples, such as trying to modify them or using them when lists would be more appropriate. They should understand how to evaluate existing code that uses tuples and suggest improvements based on best practices.*

#### Topic 3: Sets
Students will be assessed on their ability to:

**3.1 Understand how to create and modify sets**

**3.1.1 Create sets using curly braces**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create sets using curly braces syntax (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`). They should understand that sets are unordered collections of unique elements, and that duplicate values are automatically removed. Students should be able to create sets containing elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and tuples (as long as they are immutable and hashable). They should understand that sets cannot contain mutable elements like lists, dictionaries, or other sets. Students should be able to create empty sets using `set()` rather than `{}`, since `{}` creates an empty dictionary. They should understand how to create sets with duplicate elements and observe that only unique elements are retained.*

**3.1.2 Create sets using the set() constructor**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create sets using the set() constructor. They should understand how to convert other iterables to sets using this constructor, such as `set([1, 2, 3])` to convert a list to a set, or `set("hello")` to convert a string to a set of characters. Students should be able to create empty sets using `set()`. They should understand that the set() constructor accepts any iterable object and creates a new set containing all unique elements of the iterable. Students should be able to predict the result of converting different types of iterables to sets, including how duplicate elements are removed and how the order is not preserved. They should understand how creating sets from iterables can be used to eliminate duplicates from other collections.*

**3.1.3 Add elements to sets using add() and update()**
*Guidance: Students should be able to add elements to sets using the add() method for single elements (e.g., `my_set.add(element)`) and the update() method for multiple elements (e.g., `my_set.update(iterable)`). They should understand that add() adds a single element to the set if it is not already present, while update() adds all elements from an iterable that are not already in the set. Students should be able to use these methods with different types of elements and iterables, understanding that only hashable (immutable) elements can be added. They should understand how these methods modify the set in-place and do not return a value. Students should be able to trace the state of a set before and after adding elements and understand how duplicate additions are handled.*

**3.1.4 Remove elements from sets using remove(), discard(), and pop()**
*Guidance: Students should be able to remove elements from sets using the remove() method (e.g., `my_set.remove(element)`), the discard() method (e.g., `my_set.discard(element)`), and the pop() method (e.g., `my_set.pop()`). They should understand that remove() removes a specific element and raises a KeyError if the element is not present, while discard() removes a specific element if it exists and does nothing if it doesn't. Students should understand that pop() removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set and raises a KeyError if the set is empty. They should understand how these methods modify the set in-place. Students should be able to choose the appropriate method based on whether they need to handle the case where the element might not be present or whether they need to retrieve the removed element.*

**3.1.5 Clear all elements from sets using clear()**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the clear() method to remove all elements from a set (e.g., `my_set.clear()`). They should understand that clear() modifies the set in-place and returns None. Students should be able to distinguish between clear() and creating a new empty set, understanding that clear() affects all references to the same set object. They should understand the time complexity of clear() as O(1) in most Python implementations, as it typically involves releasing the internal storage of the set. Students should be able to trace the state of a set before and after clear operations and understand how it affects the set's length. They should be able to use clear() when they need to reuse a set object but remove all its current elements.*

**3.1.6 Understand set mutability and limitations**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that sets are mutable collections, meaning their contents can be changed after creation. They should understand the implications of set mutability, such as how sets can be modified in-place using methods like add(), remove(), and clear(). Students should also understand the limitations of sets, such as the requirement that elements must be hashable (immutable), which means sets cannot contain mutable objects like lists, dictionaries, or other sets. They should understand how this limitation affects the types of data that can be stored in sets and how to work around it when needed (e.g., by using tuples instead of lists). Students should be able to identify scenarios where set mutability is beneficial and scenarios where the limitations on element types might be problematic.*

**3.1.7 Copy sets to avoid unintended modifications**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create copies of sets to avoid unintended modifications when working with multiple references. They should understand the difference between shallow copy (e.g., `my_set.copy()`, `set(my_set)`) and deep copy (e.g., `copy.deepcopy(my_set)`). Students should be able to identify scenarios where shallow copy is sufficient and where deep copy is necessary (e.g., when sets contain nested mutable objects).

**3.2.1 Perform union operations on sets**
*Guidance: Students should be able to perform union operations on sets, which combine all unique elements from two or more sets. They should understand how to use the union() method (e.g., `set1.union(set2)`) or the pipe operator (|) (e.g., `set1 | set2`) to create a new set containing all elements that are in either set. Students should be able to perform union operations with multiple sets (e.g., `set1.union(set2, set3)` or `set1 | set2 | set3`). They should understand that union operations do not modify the original sets but create a new set. Students should be able to predict the result of union operations, including how duplicate elements are handled and how the order of elements is not preserved.

Students should understand that difference operations are not commutative (set1 - set2 is not the same as set2 - set1). They should understand that difference operations do not modify the original sets but create a new set. Students should be able to predict the result of difference operations, including how elements present in both sets are handled. They should be able to use difference operations in practical scenarios, such as finding elements unique to one collection.*

**3.2.4 Perform symmetric difference operations on sets**
*Guidance: Students should be able to perform symmetric difference operations on sets, which find elements that are in either set but not in both.

Students should understand that symmetric difference operations are commutative (set1 ^ set2 is the same as set2 ^ set1). They should understand that symmetric difference operations do not modify the original sets but create a new set. Students should be able to predict the result of symmetric difference operations, including how elements present in both sets are excluded. They should be able to use symmetric difference operations in practical scenarios, such as finding elements that are unique to each collection.*

**3.2.5 Use in-place set operations**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use in-place set operations, which modify the original set instead of creating a new one. They should understand how to use methods like update() for union (equivalent to `set1 |= set2`), intersection_update() for intersection (equivalent to `set1 &= set2`), difference_update() for difference (equivalent to `set1 -= set2`), and symmetric_difference_update() for symmetric difference (equivalent to `set1 ^= set2`). They should understand that in-place operations can be more memory-efficient than creating new sets, especially for large sets. Students should be able to choose between in-place operations and operations that create new sets based on whether the original set needs to be preserved. They should understand how in-place operations affect the original set and any other references to it.*

**3.2.6 Check subset and superset relationships**
*Guidance: Students should be able to check subset and superset relationships between sets using methods like issubset() (e.g., `set1.issubset(set2)` or `set1 <= set2`), issuperset() (e.g., `set1.issuperset(set2)` or `set1 >= set2`), and isdisjoint() (e.g., `set1.isdisjoint(set2)`). They should understand that a set is a subset of another set if all its elements are contained in the other set, and a superset if it contains all elements of the other set. Students should understand proper subsets (`<`) and proper supersets (`>`), which do not allow the sets to be equal. They should understand that two sets are disjoint if they have no elements in common.

Students should be able to use membership testing in conditional statements and loops to control program flow based on whether elements are present in a set. They should understand how membership testing works with different types of elements and how the hashability requirement affects which elements can be tested.

**3.3.2 Use set methods for element manipulation**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use set methods for element manipulation, including add(), remove(), discard(), pop(), and clear(). They should understand how each method works, what parameters they accept, what they return, and how they modify the set. Students should be able to choose the appropriate method based on the specific task, such as using add() for single elements, update() for multiple elements, remove() when an error is desired for missing elements, and discard() when no error is desired. They should understand how these methods handle edge cases, such as attempting to add duplicate elements or remove non-existent elements. Students should be able to trace the state of a set before and after applying these methods and understand how they affect the set's contents and properties.*

They should understand how set comprehensions are evaluated, with the expression being applied to each item in the iterable in order, and duplicates being automatically removed. Students should be able to use conditional expressions in set comprehensions to filter elements using the syntax `{expression for item in iterable if condition}`. They should understand how set comprehensions differ from list comprehensions in terms of syntax and behavior (preserving uniqueness vs. preserving order and allowing duplicates).*

**3.3.4 Use built-in functions with sets**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use various built-in functions with sets, such as len() to get the number of elements, max() and min() to find the maximum and minimum values, sum() to calculate the sum of numeric elements, and sorted() to create a sorted list from a set. They should understand how these functions work with sets and how the results differ from when used with other data structures. Students should be able to use functions like any() and all() with sets to check if any or all elements meet a condition. They should understand how to use functions like enumerate() with sets to iterate over both indices and elements, though the order is not guaranteed. Students should be able to combine these functions with set operations to solve complex problems. They should understand the time complexity of these functions when used with sets and how it compares to other data structures.*

**3.3.5 Convert between sets and other data structures**
*Guidance: Students should be able to convert between sets and other data structures, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. They should understand how to convert a set to a list using `list(my_set)`, a set to a tuple using `tuple(my_set)`, and a list to a set using `set(my_list)`. They should understand how these conversions affect properties like order, uniqueness, and mutability. Students should be able to convert between sets and dictionaries, such as creating a dictionary from a set of keys (e.g., `{key: value for key in my_set}`) or creating a set from dictionary keys (e.g., `set(my_dict.keys())`). They should understand when these conversions are useful, such as using sets to eliminate duplicates from lists or using lists to impose order on sets. Students should be able to choose the appropriate data structure for specific tasks and convert between them as needed.*

**3.3.6 Use sets with custom objects**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use sets with custom objects, understanding the requirements for objects to be hashable and therefore usable in sets. They should understand that custom objects need to implement the `__hash__()` and `__eq__()` methods to be used in sets. They should be able to implement these methods for their own classes to make instances hashable. Students should understand how the `__hash__()` method should return an integer hash value and how the `__eq__()` method should determine equality between objects. They should understand the relationship between these methods: if two objects are equal according to `__eq__()`, they must have the same hash value. Students should be able to create custom classes that can be used in sets and understand the implications of different hash and equality implementations.*

**3.3.7 Apply best practices for set methods and comprehensions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for using set methods and comprehensions effectively and efficiently.

Students should be able to use this technique with different types of collections and data. They should understand when preserving the original order is important and how to do so while still eliminating duplicates (e.g., using `dict.fromkeys()` in Python 3.7+ or a loop).

#### Topic 4: Dictionaries
Students will be assessed on their ability to:

**4.1 Understand how to create, access, and modify dictionaries**

**4.1.1 Create dictionaries using curly braces**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create dictionaries using curly braces syntax with key-value pairs (e.g., `{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}`). They should understand that dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs where each key must be unique and immutable (hashable). Students should be able to create dictionaries with different types of keys (strings, numbers, tuples) and values (any data type, including other dictionaries for nested structures). They should understand how to create empty dictionaries using `{}`. Students should be able to create dictionaries with duplicate keys and understand that only the last value for a duplicate key is retained. They should understand the importance of choosing appropriate keys that are both unique and meaningful.*

**4.1.2 Create dictionaries using the dict() constructor**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create dictionaries using the dict() constructor in various ways. They should understand how to create dictionaries from keyword arguments (e.g., `dict(key1='value1', key2='value2')`), from iterables of key-value pairs (e.g., `dict([('key1', 'value1'), ('key2', 'value2')]`), and from other dictionaries (e.g., `dict(existing_dict)`). Students should be able to create empty dictionaries using `dict()`. They should understand how the dict() constructor handles different types of input and how it differs from curly braces syntax. Students should be able to choose the most appropriate method for creating dictionaries based on the specific context and available data. They should understand how to convert other data structures, such as lists of tuples, into dictionaries using the dict() constructor.*

**4.1.3 Access dictionary values using keys**
*Guidance: Students should be able to access dictionary values using keys with square bracket notation (e.g., `my_dict['key']`). They should understand that accessing a value using a key that doesn't exist raises a KeyError. Students should be able to use the get() method as a safer alternative (e.g., `my_dict.get('key', 'default_value')`), which returns a default value if the key doesn't exist. They should understand how to check if a key exists in a dictionary using the `in` operator (e.g., `'key' in my_dict`). Students should be able to access values from nested dictionaries by chaining key accesses (e.g., `my_dict['outer_key']['inner_key']`). They should understand how to handle potential KeyErrors when accessing dictionary values, either by checking for key existence first or by using try-except blocks.*

**4.1.4 Modify dictionary values using keys**
*Guidance: Students should be able to modify dictionary values using keys with assignment notation (e.g., `my_dict['key'] = new_value`). They should understand that this operation updates the value associated with an existing key or adds a new key-value pair if the key doesn't exist. Students should be able to modify values of different data types, including mutable objects like lists or other dictionaries. They should understand how to modify nested dictionary values by chaining key accesses (e.g., `my_dict['outer_key']['inner_key'] = new_value`). Students should be able to trace the state of a dictionary before and after modification operations. They should understand how dictionary modification affects all references to the same dictionary object, unlike immutable data structures.*

**4.1.5 Add and remove key-value pairs**
*Guidance: Students should be able to add new key-value pairs to dictionaries using assignment notation (e.g., `my_dict['new_key'] = 'new_value'`). They should understand that adding a key that already exists overwrites the previous value. Students should be able to remove key-value pairs using the del statement (e.g., `del my_dict['key']`), which raises a KeyError if the key doesn't exist, or the pop() method (e.g., `my_dict.pop('key', 'default')`), which removes and returns the value and optionally returns a default if the key doesn't exist. They should understand how to use the popitem() method to remove and return an arbitrary key-value pair (useful for iterating over and emptying a dictionary). Students should be able to trace the state of a dictionary before and after adding or removing key-value pairs.*

**4.1.6 Understand dictionary mutability and key requirements**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain that dictionaries are mutable collections, meaning their contents can be changed after creation. They should understand the implications of dictionary mutability, such as how dictionaries can be modified in-place and how all references to the same dictionary object see these modifications. Students should also understand the requirements for dictionary keys: they must be hashable (immutable), which means keys can be of types like strings, numbers, and tuples (but not lists, dictionaries, or other mutable types). They should understand how to choose appropriate keys for dictionaries based on these requirements. Students should be able to identify scenarios where dictionary mutability is beneficial and scenarios where the limitations on key types might be problematic.*

**4.1.7 Copy dictionaries to avoid unintended modifications**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create copies of dictionaries to avoid unintended modifications when working with multiple references. They should understand the difference between shallow copy (e.g., `my_dict.copy()`, `dict(my_dict)`) and deep copy (e.g., `copy.deepcopy(my_dict)`). Students should be able to identify scenarios where shallow copy is sufficient and where deep copy is necessary (e.g., when dictionaries contain nested mutable objects). They should understand how to verify that two variables reference different dictionary objects using the id() function or the is operator. Students should be able to choose the appropriate copying method based on the structure of the dictionary and the requirements of the program. They should understand how dictionary copying differs from copying other data structures, particularly in terms of nested structures and key requirements.*

**4.2 Know how to use dictionary methods and operations**

**4.2.1 Use keys(), values(), and items() methods**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the keys() method to get a view of all keys in a dictionary (e.g., `my_dict.keys()`), the values() method to get a view of all values (e.g., `my_dict.values()`), and the items() method to get a view of all key-value pairs as tuples (e.g., `my_dict.items()`). They should understand that these methods return dynamic views that reflect changes to the dictionary, rather than static copies. Students should be able to convert these views to lists or other collections if needed (e.g., `list(my_dict.keys())`). They should understand how to use these methods in iteration and other operations that require access to keys, values, or both. Students should be able to choose the most appropriate method based on whether they need to work with keys, values, or key-value pairs.*

**4.2.2 Use get() method for safe value access**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the get() method to safely access dictionary values (e.g., `my_dict.get('key', 'default')`). They should understand that get() returns the value associated with the key if it exists, or a default value if the key doesn't exist (defaulting to None if no default is specified). Students should be able to compare get() with direct key access using square brackets, understanding that get() avoids KeyError exceptions when keys are missing. They should understand how to use get() in scenarios where keys might be missing and a default value is appropriate. Students should be able to use get() with nested dictionaries by chaining calls (e.g., `my_dict.get('outer_key', {}).get('inner_key', 'default')`). They should understand how get() can make code more robust and readable by handling missing keys gracefully.*

**4.2.3 Use update() method to merge dictionaries**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the update() method to merge dictionaries (e.g., `dict1.update(dict2)`). They should understand that update() modifies the first dictionary in-place by adding key-value pairs from the second dictionary. Students should be able to understand how update() handles duplicate keys: values from the second dictionary overwrite values from the first dictionary for the same keys. They should be able to use update() with different types of input, including other dictionaries, iterables of key-value pairs, and keyword arguments. Students should understand how update() differs from creating a new merged dictionary (e.g., using `{**dict1, **dict2}` in Python 3.5+). They should be able to choose between update() and other merging methods based on whether the original dictionary should be modified or a new dictionary should be created.*

**4.2.4 Use setdefault() method for key initialization**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use the setdefault() method to get a value from a dictionary or set a default if the key doesn't exist (e.g., `my_dict.setdefault('key', 'default')`). They should understand that setdefault() returns the value associated with the key if it exists, or inserts the key with the default value and returns the default if the key doesn't exist. Students should be able to compare setdefault() with get() and direct key access, understanding that setdefault() modifies the dictionary when keys are missing, while get() does not. They should understand how to use setdefault() for initializing keys with complex default values, such as empty lists or dictionaries (e.g., `my_dict.setdefault('key', []).append('value')`). Students should be able to identify scenarios where setdefault() is more appropriate than other methods for handling missing keys.*

**4.2.5 Use dictionary comparison operations**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use comparison operators (==, !=) to compare dictionaries. They should understand how dictionary comparison works: two dictionaries are equal if they have the same key-value pairs, regardless of the order in which they were added. Students should be able to predict the result of comparing dictionaries with different key-value pairs, different orders, or different types of keys and values. They should understand that other comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=) are not defined for dictionaries in Python 3, unlike in Python 2. Students should be able to use dictionary comparison in conditional statements and other operations that need to check if two dictionaries are equivalent. They should understand how dictionary comparison differs from comparison of other data structures, particularly in terms of order sensitivity.*

**4.2.6 Use dictionary operations with nested structures**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use dictionary operations with nested structures, such as dictionaries containing other dictionaries or lists. They should understand how to access, modify, and perform operations on nested dictionary structures using chained key access (e.g., `my_dict['outer_key']['inner_key']`). Students should be able to use methods like get() and setdefault() with nested structures by chaining method calls (e.g., `my_dict.get('outer_key', {}).get('inner_key', 'default')`). They should understand how to iterate over nested dictionaries using nested loops or comprehensions. Students should be able to perform operations like updating, copying, and comparing nested dictionaries, understanding how these operations affect the nested structure. They should be able to identify scenarios where nested dictionaries are appropriate and how to work with them effectively.*

**4.2.7 Apply best practices for dictionary methods and operations**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for using dictionary methods and operations effectively and efficiently.

Students should be able to use dictionary operations in a way that makes code clear and maintainable, with appropriate variable names and comments when necessary. They should understand the performance implications of different dictionary operations and methods and choose the most efficient approach for the specific use case. Students should be able to identify and avoid common pitfalls when working with dictionaries, such as modifying a dictionary while iterating over it or using unhashable types as keys.*

They should understand that dictionary comprehensions provide a concise way to create dictionaries based on existing iterables. Students should be able to use dictionary comprehensions to transform elements from an iterable into key-value pairs (e.g., `{x: x*2 for x in range(5)}` to create `{0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 6, 4: 8}`). They should understand how dictionary comprehensions are evaluated, with the key and value expressions being applied to each item in the iterable in order. Students should be able to use dictionary comprehensions with different types of iterables, including lists, tuples, and other dictionaries. They should understand how dictionary comprehensions handle duplicate keys, with the last occurrence of a key determining its value in the resulting dictionary.*

**4.3.2 Use conditional expressions in dictionary comprehensions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use conditional expressions in dictionary comprehensions to filter elements using the syntax `{key_expr: value_expr for item in iterable if condition}`. They should understand that the condition is evaluated for each item in the iterable, and only items for which the condition is True are included in the resulting dictionary. Students should be able to use conditions with comparison operators, logical operators, and function calls. They should understand how to combine multiple conditions using logical operators. Students should be able to use conditional expressions to filter elements based on their keys, values, or other properties. They should be able to trace the evaluation of conditional dictionary comprehensions and predict the resulting dictionaries.*

**4.3.3 Use if-else expressions in dictionary comprehensions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use if-else expressions in dictionary comprehensions to apply different transformations based on conditions using the syntax `{key_expr: value_expr1 if condition else value_expr2 for item in iterable}`. They should understand that this syntax allows for conditional transformations of values while still including all items in the resulting dictionary. Students should be able to distinguish between filtering with if conditions at the end and conditional transformations with if-else expressions in the values. They should understand how if-else expressions are evaluated for each item in the iterable, with value_expr1 being used if the condition is True and value_expr2 being used if the condition is False. Students should be able to use if-else expressions to apply different transformations based on element properties.*

**4.3.4 Create nested dictionary comprehensions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create nested dictionary comprehensions to generate dictionaries of dictionaries or to transform nested structures. They should understand the syntax for nested dictionary comprehensions, such as `{outer_key: {inner_key: inner_value for inner_item in inner_iterable} for outer_item in outer_iterable}` for creating dictionaries of dictionaries. Students should be able to use nested dictionary comprehensions to flatten nested structures or to create hierarchical data structures. They should understand how nested dictionary comprehensions are evaluated, with the outer comprehension running first and the inner comprehension running for each iteration of the outer comprehension.

*Guidance: Students should be able to compare dictionary comprehensions with traditional for loops for creating dictionaries. They should understand the advantages of dictionary comprehensions, including conciseness, readability for simple transformations, and potential performance benefits. Students should be able to identify scenarios where dictionary comprehensions are appropriate (simple transformations and filtering) and scenarios where traditional loops are more suitable (complex logic, multiple statements, or when side effects are needed). They should understand how to convert between dictionary comprehensions and equivalent for loops. Students should be able to evaluate the readability and maintainability of both approaches and choose the most appropriate one based on the specific requirements. They should understand how to add comments to complex dictionary comprehensions to improve readability when necessary.*

**4.3.7 Apply best practices for dictionary comprehensions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for writing clear and effective dictionary comprehensions.

Students should be able to identify and avoid common pitfalls when using dictionary comprehensions, such as creating duplicate keys or using expressions that are too complex.*

**4.4 Understand how to iterate over dictionaries**

**4.4.1 Iterate over dictionary keys using basic for loops**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use basic for loops to iterate over dictionary keys using the syntax `for key in my_dict:`. They should understand that this approach provides direct access to each key in the dictionary, and that the order of iteration is the insertion order of the keys (in Python 3.7+). Students should be able to use this method to access keys and perform operations on them, such as printing, checking conditions, or accessing corresponding values. They should understand how to access values within the loop using the current key (e.g., `my_dict[key]`). Students should be able to trace the execution of for loops over dictionary keys and understand how the loop variable changes with each iteration. They should understand that this is the most common and concise way to iterate over dictionaries when only keys are needed.*

**4.4.2 Iterate over dictionary keys explicitly**
*Guidance: Students should be able to iterate over dictionary keys explicitly using the keys() method (e.g., `for key in my_dict.keys():`). They should understand that this approach is functionally equivalent to the basic for loop but makes the intent more explicit. Students should be able to use this method when they want to clearly indicate that they are iterating over keys. They should understand how keys() returns a dynamic view of the dictionary's keys, which reflects changes to the dictionary. Students should be able to convert the keys view to a list or other collection if needed (e.g., `for key in list(my_dict.keys()):`). They should understand when to use explicit key iteration versus other methods of dictionary iteration based on the specific requirements of the task.*

**4.4.3 Iterate over dictionary values**
*Guidance: Students should be able to iterate over dictionary values using the values() method (e.g., `for value in my_dict.values():`). They should understand that this approach provides direct access to each value in the dictionary, without access to the corresponding keys. Students should be able to use this method when they only need to work with the values and don't need to know the associated keys. They should understand how values() returns a dynamic view of the dictionary's values, which reflects changes to the dictionary. Students should be able to convert the values view to a list or other collection if needed (e.g., `for value in list(my_dict.values()):`). They should understand when to use value iteration versus other methods of dictionary iteration based on the specific requirements of the task.*

**4.4.4 Iterate over dictionary key-value pairs**
*Guidance: Students should be able to iterate over dictionary key-value pairs using the items() method (e.g., `for key, value in my_dict.items():`). They should understand that this approach provides access to both keys and values in each iteration, using tuple unpacking to assign them to separate variables. Students should be able to use this method when they need to work with both keys and values together. They should understand how items() returns a dynamic view of the dictionary's key-value pairs as tuples, which reflects changes to the dictionary. Students should be able to convert the items view to a list or other collection if needed (e.g., `for key, value in list(my_dict.items()):`). They should understand when to use key-value pair iteration versus other methods of dictionary iteration based on the specific requirements of the task.*

**4.4.5 Iterate over dictionaries in sorted order**
*Guidance: Students should be able to iterate over dictionaries in sorted order by keys, values, or custom criteria. They should understand how to use the sorted() function with dictionary keys (e.g., `for key in sorted(my_dict):`), values (e.g., `for value in sorted(my_dict.values()):`), or items (e.g., `for key, value in sorted(my_dict.items()):`). Students should be able to use custom sorting criteria by providing a key function to sorted() (e.g., `for key, value in sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]):` to sort by values). They should understand how to sort in reverse order using the reverse parameter. Students should be able to iterate over dictionaries in sorted order when the order of processing matters, such as when generating reports or displaying data. They should understand the performance implications of sorting dictionaries before iteration, especially for large dictionaries.*

**4.4.6 Modify dictionaries during iteration**
*Guidance: Students should be able to modify dictionaries during iteration using appropriate techniques. They should understand that modifying a dictionary while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, such as skipping keys or causing RuntimeError. Students should be able to use techniques like iterating over a copy of the keys (e.g., `for key in list(my_dict.keys()):`) or items (e.g., `for key, value in list(my_dict.items()):`) when they need to modify the dictionary. They should understand how to safely add, remove, or modify key-value pairs during iteration without causing issues. Students should be able to identify common pitfalls when modifying dictionaries during iteration and use appropriate techniques to avoid them. They should understand the trade-offs between different approaches to modifying dictionaries during iteration in terms of memory usage and performance.*

**4.4.7 Use dictionary iteration for common operations**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use dictionary iteration to perform common operations such as filtering key-value pairs, transforming values, accumulating values, and searching for specific keys or values. They should understand how to use loops to filter dictionaries based on conditions, either by creating a new dictionary with the filtered items or by removing items from the original dictionary. Students should be able to use loops to transform values in a dictionary, either by modifying values in-place or by creating a new dictionary with transformed values. They should understand how to use loops to accumulate values, such as calculating sums, products, or other aggregates. Students should be able to use loops to search for specific keys or values that meet certain criteria and either return the found items or their indices. They should be able to choose the most appropriate iteration method for each operation.*

Students should be able to use the finally clause for cleanup operations that must always be performed, such as closing files, releasing resources, or restoring state. They should understand how the finally clause executes even if there's a return statement in the try or except blocks. Students should be able to identify scenarios where using a finally clause is essential, such as when working with external resources that must be properly released. They should understand how the finally clause differs from placing cleanup code after the try-except block, which wouldn't execute if an uncaught exception occurred. Students should be able to write try-except-finally blocks that ensure proper cleanup regardless of exceptions.*

**3.4.3 Combine else and finally clauses**
*Guidance: Students should be able to combine else and finally clauses with try-except blocks using the syntax `try: # code that might raise an exception except ExceptionType: # code to handle the exception else: # code to execute if no exception was raised finally: # code that always executes`. They should understand the execution flow of this combined structure: the try block executes first, if no exception occurs the else block executes, and regardless of whether an exception occurred or was caught, the finally block always executes last. Students should be able to use this combined structure for scenarios that require both success-path processing and guaranteed cleanup. They should understand how the order of execution works in different scenarios: when no exception occurs, when an exception is caught, and when an exception is not caught. Students should be able to identify scenarios where using both else and finally clauses is appropriate, such as when processing files where success requires additional processing but cleanup is always needed. Students should be able to write try-except-else-finally blocks that correctly handle all execution paths.*

**3.4.4 Understand the execution order of try-except-else-finally blocks**
*Guidance: Students should be able to understand and trace the execution order of try-except-else-finally blocks in different scenarios. They should understand that in the normal case (no exception), the try block executes, then the else block, and finally the finally block. Students should be able to trace execution when an exception is caught: the try block executes up to the exception, then the except block, and finally the finally block. They should understand that when an exception is not caught, the try block executes up to the exception, then the finally block, and then the exception propagates to the caller. Students should be able to trace execution when there's a return statement in the try or except blocks, understanding that the finally block still executes before the function returns. They should be able to predict the output of code with try-except-else-finally blocks in different scenarios. Students should be able to write code that demonstrates their understanding of the execution order in different situations.*

**3.4.5 Handle resource management with finally blocks**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use finally blocks for effective resource management in their programs. They should understand how to use finally blocks to ensure that resources like files, network connections, database connections, or locks are properly released, regardless of whether an exception occurred. Students should be able to write code that opens resources in try blocks and ensures they are closed in finally blocks. They should understand how to handle cases where multiple resources need to be managed, possibly with nested try-finally blocks. Students should be able to compare the finally block approach with context managers (the with statement) and understand when each is more appropriate. They should understand how to handle exceptions that might occur during the cleanup operations in finally blocks. Students should be able to write robust code that properly manages resources using finally blocks, ensuring no resource leaks occur even in exceptional circumstances.*

**3.4.6 Use context managers with exception handling**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use context managers (the with statement) in combination with exception handling. They should understand how context managers provide a structured way to manage resources and ensure proper cleanup, even when exceptions occur. Students should be able to use built-in context managers like those for file operations (`with open(...) as f:`) and understand how they implement the context manager protocol. They should be able to create custom context managers using classes or the @contextmanager decorator to manage their own resources. They should understand how context managers relate to try-except-finally blocks, with the __exit__ method of a context manager serving a similar purpose to a finally block. Students should be able to combine context managers with try-except blocks for scenarios where both resource management and exception handling are needed. They should be able to write code that effectively uses context managers for resource management in combination with exception handling.*

**3.4.7 Apply best practices for else and finally clauses**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for using else and finally clauses in their exception handling code. They should understand when to use else clauses versus placing code after the try-except block, based on whether the code should only execute if no exceptions occurred. Students should be able to use finally clauses judiciously for critical cleanup operations, understanding that they always execute regardless of exceptions. They should understand how to avoid placing return statements in finally blocks, which can mask exceptions and make debugging difficult. Students should be able to keep finally blocks simple and focused on cleanup, avoiding complex logic that might itself raise exceptions. They should understand how to document

They should understand when to create custom exceptions versus using built-in exceptions, based on factors like specificity, reusability, and clarity. Students should be able to design custom exceptions that are specific to their application domain but not so granular that they become unwieldy. They should understand how to balance between providing rich context in exceptions and keeping them simple and focused. Students should be able to follow naming conventions and make custom exceptions easily discoverable and understandable. They should understand how to ensure custom exceptions are properly integrated with the existing exception hierarchy. Students should be able to design custom exceptions that improve the overall error handling strategy of their applications rather than complicating it. They should be able to evaluate their custom exception designs against best practices and refine them as needed.*

**4.2 Know when to raise exceptions**

**4.2.1 Identify appropriate scenarios for raising exceptions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to identify scenarios where raising exceptions is the appropriate error handling strategy. They should understand that exceptions should be raised for exceptional conditions that prevent normal program execution, not for expected control flow. Students should be able to distinguish between errors that should be handled with exceptions versus those that should be handled with return codes or conditional logic. They should understand how to identify conditions that truly represent exceptional circumstances, such as invalid input, resource unavailability, or violations of preconditions. Students should be able to recognize when an error condition is severe enough to warrant interrupting the normal flow of execution. They should understand how to consider the perspective of the caller when deciding whether to raise an exception or handle the condition locally. Students should be able to analyze their code and identify appropriate points where exceptions should be raised.*

**4.2.2 Raise exceptions for invalid input or state**
*Guidance: Students should be able to raise exceptions for invalid input or state conditions that prevent normal operation. They should understand how to validate input parameters and raise exceptions like ValueError or TypeError with meaningful messages when invalid values are detected. Students should be able to check preconditions and raise exceptions when they are not met, such as requiring positive numbers or non-empty strings. They should understand how to create custom exceptions that specifically represent invalid input or state conditions in their application domain. Students should be able to document the conditions under which exceptions will be raised, helping users understand the requirements for valid input. They should understand how to balance between strict validation that raises exceptions for any invalid input and more permissive validation that handles some invalid cases gracefully. Students should be able to write input validation code that raises appropriate exceptions with clear error messages.*

**4.2.3 Raise exceptions for resource-related errors**
*Guidance: Students should be able to raise exceptions for errors related to resource management, such as file operations, network connections, or database access.

Students should be able to write resource management code that raises appropriate exceptions when resource operations fail.*

**4.2.4 Raise exceptions for programming errors**
*Guidance: Students should be able to raise exceptions for programming errors that indicate bugs or incorrect usage of APIs. They should understand how to use assertions to check for programming errors and raise AssertionError exceptions when they occur. Students should be able to raise exceptions like ValueError or TypeError when methods are called with incorrect parameters or types. They should understand how to create custom exceptions that specifically represent programming errors in their application. They should be able to distinguish between programming errors (which should be fixed in the code) and runtime errors (which should be handled gracefully). Students should understand how to provide clear error messages that help developers identify and fix programming errors. They should understand when to raise exceptions immediately when a programming error is detected versus when to log the error and continue with a default behavior. Students should be able to write code that raises appropriate exceptions for programming errors with helpful diagnostic information.*

**4.2.5 Choose between raising exceptions and returning error codes**
*Guidance: Students should be able to make informed decisions about when to raise exceptions versus when to return error codes or special values. They should understand the advantages of exceptions, such as separating error handling from normal control flow and providing detailed error information. Students should be able to recognize scenarios where returning error codes is more appropriate, such as in performance-critical code or when errors are expected and frequent. They should understand how to consider the perspective of the code's users when deciding between exceptions and error codes. Students should be able to evaluate factors like the severity of errors, the frequency of error conditions, and the impact on code readability and maintainability. They should understand how to balance between using exceptions for truly exceptional conditions and using return values for expected alternative outcomes. Students should be able to design APIs that use an appropriate mix of exceptions and return values based on these considerations.*

**4.2.6 Chain exceptions to preserve context**
*Guidance: Students should be able to chain exceptions to preserve context when handling and re-raising exceptions. They should understand how to use the `raise ... from ...` syntax to chain exceptions, maintaining the original exception context. Students should be able to catch low-level exceptions and raise higher-level, more meaningful exceptions while preserving the original exception as the cause. They should understand how exception chaining helps with debugging by providing a complete picture of what went wrong and why. Students should be able to access the original exception from a chained exception using the `__cause__` attribute. They should understand when to chain exceptions versus when to handle them completely and raise new unrelated exceptions. Students should be able to write exception handling code that properly chains exceptions to provide complete context for debugging.*

**4.2.7 Apply best practices for raising exceptions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for raising exceptions in their code. They should understand the principle of "fail fast" - raising exceptions as soon as an error condition is detected rather than allowing the program to continue in an invalid state. Students should be able to raise exceptions with clear, specific, and actionable error messages that help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it. They should understand how to choose the most appropriate exception type for each error condition, whether built-in or custom. Students should be able to avoid raising exceptions for normal control flow, using them only for truly exceptional conditions. They should understand how to document the exceptions that their code might raise, helping users write appropriate exception handling. Students should be able to write code that raises exceptions judiciously and effectively, improving the reliability and debuggability of their applications.*

**4.3 Be able to use assertions for debugging**

**4.3.1 Write basic assertions using the assert statement**
*Guidance: Students should be able to write basic assertions using the `assert` statement with the syntax `assert condition, "error message"`. They should understand that assertions check that a condition is true and raise an AssertionError with the specified message if the condition is false. Students should be able to use assertions to verify assumptions about the state of the program, such as preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. They should understand how assertions are primarily intended for debugging and development, not for handling runtime errors in production code. Students should be able to write simple assertions that check basic conditions, such as variable values or relationships between variables. They should understand how to provide clear error messages in assertions that explain what assumption was violated and why it matters. Students should be able to use assertions effectively as a debugging tool to verify program correctness during development.*

**4.3.2 Use assertions for preconditions and postconditions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use assertions to verify preconditions and postconditions in their functions and methods. They should understand that preconditions are conditions that must be true before a function executes, such as valid input parameters or required system state. Students should be able to write assertions at the beginning of functions to check preconditions, providing clear error messages when they are violated. They should understand that postconditions are conditions that must be true after a function executes, such as return value constraints or changes to system state. Students should be able to write assertions at the end of functions to check postconditions, ensuring that the function has fulfilled its contract. They should understand how to use assertions to document and enforce the contract of functions, making code more reliable and self-documenting. Students should be able to write functions with clear preconditions and postconditions verified by assertions.*

**4.3.3 Use assertions for invariants and class invariants**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use assertions to verify invariants in their code, particularly class invariants. They should understand that invariants are conditions that must always be true at specific points in the program, such as during or after certain operations. Students should be able to identify invariants in their code and write assertions to verify them. They should understand that class invariants are conditions that must be true for all instances of a class throughout their lifetime. Students should be able to write methods that check class invariants and call them at appropriate points, such as after construction or modification. They should understand how to use assertions to verify that data structures maintain their integrity after operations. Students should be able to write code that uses assertions to verify invariants, helping to catch bugs early and making code more robust.*

**4.3.4 Control assertion behavior with the -O flag**
*Guidance: Students should be able to control assertion behavior using Python's -O (optimize) flag. They should understand that assertions are enabled by default in Python but can be disabled by running Python with the -O flag. Students should be able to explain that when assertions are disabled, all assert statements are effectively removed from the code, and no AssertionError exceptions are raised. They should understand the implications of this behavior for production code, where assertions are typically disabled for performance reasons. Students should be able to run Python scripts with assertions enabled (default) or disabled (-O flag) depending on their needs. They should understand how to design code that works correctly both with and without assertions, using assertions only for debugging and development, not for critical runtime checks. Students should be able to make informed decisions about when to rely on assertions and when to use other error handling mechanisms that remain active in production.*

**4.3.5 Differentiate assertions from other error handling**
*Guidance: Students should be able to differentiate between assertions and other error handling mechanisms like exceptions and return codes. They should understand that assertions are intended for debugging and development, not for handling runtime errors that might occur in production. Students should be able to explain that assertions check for programming errors and violations of assumptions that should never occur in correct code, while exceptions handle runtime errors that might occur even in correct code. They should understand how assertions are typically disabled in production code, while exception handling remains active. Students should be able to identify scenarios where assertions are appropriate (debugging, development, testing) versus scenarios where exceptions are more appropriate (runtime error handling in production). They should understand how to choose between assertions and other error handling mechanisms based on the nature of the error condition and the environment where the code will run. Students should be able to write code that uses the appropriate error handling mechanism for each type of error condition.*

**4.3.6 Write effective assertion messages**
*Guidance: Students should be able to write effective assertion messages that provide clear and helpful information when assertions fail. They should understand that good assertion messages explain what assumption was violated, why it matters, and potentially how to fix it. Students should be able to write assertion messages that include relevant variable values or other context that helps with debugging. They should understand how to structure assertion messages to be concise yet informative, avoiding overly technical jargon while still being precise. Students should be able to write assertion messages that help developers quickly identify and fix the underlying issue. They should understand how to balance between providing enough information in assertion messages and keeping them manageable and readable. Students should be able to write assertions with messages that significantly improve the debugging process when assertions fail.*

**4.3.7 Apply best practices for using assertions**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for using assertions effectively in their code. They should understand that assertions should be used for debugging and development, not for handling runtime errors in production. Students should be able to use assertions to verify assumptions, preconditions, postconditions, and invariants, making code more reliable and self-documenting. They should understand how to write assertions that are simple and focused, checking one condition at a time rather than complex expressions. They should be able to avoid using assertions with side effects, as this can lead to different behavior between development and production environments. Students should understand how to use assertions judiciously, focusing on critical assumptions that are most likely to be violated or have the most impact if they are. They should be able to write code that uses assertions effectively as a debugging tool while following these best practices.*

**4.4 Understand logging and debugging techniques**

**4.4.1 Configure basic logging using the logging module**
*Guidance: Students should be able to configure basic logging using Python's logging module. They should understand how to import the logging module and use basic functions like logging.debug(), logging.info(), logging.warning(), logging.error(), and logging.critical() to log messages at different severity levels.

Students should be able to write code that uses logging as an effective debugging and monitoring tool.*

**4.4.4 Use Python's built-in debugger (pdb)**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use Python's built-in debugger (pdb) to debug their code interactively. They should understand how to import pdb and use pdb.set_trace() to set breakpoints in their code.

Students should be able to use appropriate logging levels consistently throughout their code, making it easier to filter and analyze logs. They should understand how to avoid logging sensitive information like passwords or personal data in production logs. Students should be able to configure logging appropriately for different environments, with detailed debug logging in development and more selective logging in production. They should understand how to use debugging tools effectively, focusing on identifying the root cause of issues rather than just symptoms. Students should be able to document their debugging strategies and logging configurations to help other developers understand how to diagnose issues. They should be able to write code that incorporates effective logging and debugging practices that make maintenance and troubleshooting easier.*

- __ marks
- Calculators may not be used

### P5.3 Unit Content

#### Topic 1: Classes and Objects
Students will be assessed on their ability to:

**1.1 Understand how to define classes and create objects**

**1.1.1 Define basic classes using the class keyword**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define basic classes using the `class` keyword followed by a class name and a colon. They should understand that class names typically follow CamelCase convention in Python. Students should be able to create empty classes using the `pass` statement as a placeholder. They should understand that classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, defining the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have. Students should be able to explain the difference between a class (the blueprint) and an object (an instance of the class). They should understand how classes encapsulate data and functionality related to a specific concept or entity. Students should be able to write simple class definitions that represent real-world concepts or abstract data types.*

**1.1.2 Create objects (instances) from classes**
*Guidance: Students should be able to create objects (instances) from classes by calling the class name followed by parentheses, similar to calling a function (e.g., `my_object = MyClass()`). They should understand that each object is a separate instance of the class, with its own data but sharing the same methods and structure. Students should be able to create multiple objects from the same class and understand that they are independent of each other. They should understand how to verify that an object is an instance of a particular class using the `isinstance()` function. Students should be able to explain the relationship between classes and objects, using analogies like a blueprint and houses built from that blueprint. They should be able to create objects from their defined classes and work with them in their programs.*

**1.1.3 Define and use the __init__ method**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define and use the `__init__` method to initialize objects when they are created. They should understand that `__init__` is a special method called a constructor that is automatically invoked when a new object is created. Students should be able to define `__init__` with parameters to accept values for initializing the object's attributes. They should understand how to use the `self` parameter to refer to the object being initialized and set instance variables. Students should be able to provide default values for parameters in `__init__` to make object creation more flexible. They should understand that `__init__` should not return a value (other than None). Students should be able to write classes with `__init__` methods that properly initialize objects with the required attributes.*

**1.1.4 Define and use class variables**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define and use class variables, which are variables shared by all instances of a class. They should understand that class variables are defined within the class but outside of any methods, typically at the beginning of the class definition. Students should be able to access class variables using either the class name (e.g., `MyClass.class_variable`) or an instance (e.g., `my_object.class_variable`). They should understand that modifying a class variable through one instance affects all instances, as they all share the same class variable. Students should be able to distinguish between class variables and instance variables, understanding that class variables are shared across all instances while instance variables are specific to each instance. They should be able to use class variables appropriately for data that should be shared among all instances of a class, such as constants or configuration values.*

**1.1.5 Define and use static methods**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define and use static methods using the `@staticmethod` decorator. They should understand that static methods are methods that belong to the class rather than to any particular instance of the class. Students should be able to define static methods that do not take the `self` parameter, as they do not operate on instance data. They should understand how to call static methods using either the class name (e.g., `MyClass.static_method()`) or an instance (e.g., `my_object.static_method()`). Students should be able to identify scenarios where static methods are appropriate, such as utility functions that are related to the class but do not depend on instance data. They should understand how static methods differ from instance methods and class methods. Students should be able to write static methods that perform operations related to the class without requiring access to instance data.*

**1.1.6 Define and use class methods**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define and use class methods using the `@classmethod` decorator. They should understand that class methods take the class itself as the first parameter, conventionally named `cls`, rather than the instance (`self`). Students should be able to define class methods that operate on the class rather than on instances of the class. They should understand how to call class methods using either the class name (e.g., `MyClass.class_method()`) or an instance (e.g., `my_object.class_method()`). Students should be able to identify scenarios where class methods are appropriate, such as factory methods that create instances with specific configurations or methods that modify class-level state. They should understand how class methods differ from instance methods and static methods. Students should be able to write class methods that operate on the class and can be used as alternative constructors or for modifying class-level state.*

**1.1.7 Compare classes to other data structures**
*Guidance: Students should be able to compare classes to other data structures like dictionaries, lists, and tuples. They should understand that classes provide a way to bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together into a single object, while other data structures primarily store data. Students should be able to explain how classes support encapsulation, allowing data to be protected and accessed through methods, while other data structures typically expose their data directly. They should understand how classes enable the creation of custom types with specific behaviors, while other data structures are fixed in their behavior. Students should be able to identify scenarios where classes are more appropriate than other data structures, such as when representing complex entities with behavior or when data integrity needs to be enforced. They should be able to explain the trade-offs between using classes and other data structures in terms of complexity, flexibility, and performance.*

**1.2 Know how to use instance variables and methods**

**1.2.1 Define and access instance variables**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define and access instance variables, which are variables that belong to individual objects. They should understand that instance variables are typically defined in the `__init__` method using the `self` parameter (e.g., `self.variable = value`). Students should be able to access instance variables from within methods using the `self` parameter (e.g., `self.variable`) and from outside the object using dot notation (e.g., `my_object.variable`). They should understand that each instance of a class has its own copy of instance variables, so changes to an instance variable in one object do not affect other objects. Students should be able to distinguish between instance variables (specific to each object) and class variables (shared across all objects). They should be able to create classes with appropriate instance variables that represent the state of individual objects.*

**1.2.2 Define and use instance methods**
*Guidance: Students should be able to define and use instance methods, which are functions that belong to objects and operate on instance data. They should understand that instance methods are defined within a class and take at least one parameter, conventionally named `self`, which refers to the instance the method is called on. Students should be able to define instance methods that access and modify instance variables using the `self` parameter. They should understand how to call instance methods on objects using dot notation (e.g., `my_object.method()`). They should be able to create instance methods that perform operations relevant to the object's purpose and state. Students should understand how instance methods differ from static methods and class methods in terms of their relationship to instance data. They should be able to write classes with instance methods that provide appropriate behavior for the objects.*

**1.2.3 Modify instance variables within methods**
*Guidance: Students should be able to modify instance variables within methods using the `self` parameter. They should understand how to update the state of an object by changing the values of its instance variables. Students should be able to write methods that validate new values before assigning them to instance variables, enforcing data integrity. They should understand how methods can modify multiple instance variables in a coordinated way to maintain object consistency. Students should be able to create methods that transform the state of an object in meaningful ways, such as updating position, changing properties, or processing data. They should understand how modifying instance variables within methods encapsulates the object's state changes, making the object's behavior more predictable and controllable. Students should be able to write methods that appropriately modify instance variables to implement the object's behavior.*

**1.2.4 Implement getter and setter methods**
*Guidance: Students should be able to implement getter and setter methods to control access to instance variables. They should understand that getter methods (accessors) retrieve the values of instance variables, while setter methods (mutators) modify them. Students should be able to write getter methods that return instance variable values and setter methods that validate and assign new values. They should understand how getter and setter methods provide a way to enforce constraints on instance variables, such as type checking or range validation. Students should be able to use naming conventions for getter and setter methods, such as `get_variable()` and `set_variable()`. They should understand how getter and setter methods encapsulate access to instance variables, allowing the internal representation to change without affecting code that uses the class. Students should be able to write classes with getter and setter methods that provide controlled access to instance variables.*

**1.2.5 Use properties for controlled attribute access**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use properties to provide controlled access to instance variables while maintaining a simple attribute-like interface. They should understand how to define properties using the `@property` decorator for getters and the `@variable.setter` decorator for setters. Students should be able to create properties that look like attributes when accessed but actually call getter and setter methods behind the scenes. They should understand how properties allow for validation, computation, or other processing when getting or setting values, while maintaining a clean interface. Students should be able to use properties to implement read-only or write-only attributes by only defining a getter or setter. They should understand how properties differ from explicit getter and setter methods in terms of usage and appearance. Students should be able to write classes with properties that provide controlled access to instance variables while maintaining a simple interface.*

**1.2.6 Implement method overloading**
*Guidance: Students should be able to implement method overloading in Python, understanding that Python does not support traditional method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) as in some other languages. They should understand how to achieve similar functionality using default parameter values, variable-length argument lists (*args, **kwargs), or type checking within a single method. Students should be able to write methods that can handle different types or numbers of parameters by using these techniques. They should understand how to use type checking to provide different behavior based on the types of arguments passed to a method. Students should be able to create methods that provide flexibility in how they are called while maintaining clear and predictable behavior. They should be able to write classes with methods that can be called in multiple ways, providing similar functionality to method overloading in other languages.*

**1.2.7 Apply encapsulation principles**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply encapsulation principles in their class designs. They should understand that encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), while restricting direct access to some of the object's components. Students should be able to use naming conventions like prefixing with an underscore (e.g., `_variable`) to indicate that an attribute or method is intended for internal use. They should understand how to use properties, getter and setter methods, or other techniques to control access to instance variables rather than exposing them directly. Students should be able to design classes that hide implementation details and expose only necessary interfaces, making the code more maintainable and reducing the impact of changes. They should understand how encapsulation improves code organization, reduces complexity, and prevents unintended interference with an object's internal state. Students should be able to write classes that follow encapsulation principles, providing clear interfaces while hiding implementation details.*

**1.3 Be able to use the self parameter**

**1.3.1 Understand the purpose of the self parameter**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain the purpose of the `self` parameter in Python instance methods. They should understand that `self` refers to the instance of the class on which a method is being called, allowing the method to access and modify the instance's attributes and other methods. Students should be able to explain that `self` is not a keyword in Python but a convention, though it is strongly recommended to follow this convention for clarity. They should understand how `self` is automatically passed as the first parameter when a method is called on an instance (e.g., `my_object.method()` is equivalent to `MyClass.method(my_object)`). Students should be able to trace how `self` is used within methods to reference instance variables and other methods. They should understand that `self` is similar to `this` in other object-oriented languages like Java or C++. Students should be able to use the `self` parameter correctly in their method definitions.*

**1.3.2 Use self to access instance variables**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use `self` to access instance variables within methods. They should understand that instance variables are accessed using dot notation with `self` (e.g., `self.variable`). Students should be able to read the values of instance variables using `self` and use them in method logic. They should understand how to modify instance variables by assigning new values to `self.variable`. Students should be able to distinguish between accessing instance variables (using `self.variable`) and local variables (defined within the method without `self`). They should understand how `self` provides a way to maintain state across method calls, as instance variables persist as long as the object exists. Students should be able to write methods that correctly use `self` to access and modify instance variables.*

**1.3.3 Use self to call other instance methods**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use `self` to call other instance methods within a class. They should understand that instance methods are called on `self` using dot notation (e.g., `self.other_method()`). Students should be able to write methods that call other methods of the same object to break down complex operations into smaller, more manageable pieces. They should understand how calling methods through `self` allows for better code organization and reuse within a class. Students should be able to trace the flow of execution when methods call other methods through `self`. They should understand how this technique promotes code reuse and makes classes more maintainable. Students should be able to write classes with methods that appropriately call other methods through `self` to implement complex behaviors.*

**1.3.4 Distinguish between self and class names**
*Guidance: Students should be able to distinguish between using `self` and the class name when accessing attributes and methods. They should understand that `self` refers to the specific instance of the class, allowing access to instance variables and methods, while the class name refers to the class itself, allowing access to class variables and static/class methods. Students should be able to identify when to use `self.variable` (instance variable) versus `ClassName.variable` (class variable). They should understand how to call instance methods using `self.method()` and static/class methods using `ClassName.method()`. Students should be able to explain the difference in behavior when modifying attributes through `self` versus through the class name. They should understand how to choose between `self` and the class name based on whether they need to work with instance-specific data or class-level data and behavior. Students should be able to write code that correctly uses both `self` and class names to access the appropriate attributes and methods.*

**1.3.5 Use self in constructor (__init__) methods**
*Guidance: Students should be able to use `self` effectively in constructor (`__init__`) methods. They should understand that `self` in `__init__` refers to the new object being created, allowing them to initialize the object's attributes. Students should be able to define instance variables in `__init__` by assigning values to attributes of `self` (e.g., `self.variable = value`). They should understand how to accept parameters in `__init__` and use them to initialize instance variables through `self`. Students should be able to call other methods of the object from within `__init__` using `self`, though they should be cautious about calling methods that depend on initialization that hasn't occurred yet. They should understand how `self` allows the constructor to set up the initial state of the object. Students should be able to write `__init__` methods that properly use `self` to initialize objects with the required attributes.*

**1.3.6 Compare self with similar concepts in other languages**
*Guidance: Students should be able to compare Python's `self` parameter with similar concepts in other object-oriented languages. They should understand that `self` in Python is similar to `this` in languages like Java, C#, and JavaScript, or `self` in Ruby and Swift. Students should be able to explain that while these concepts serve the same purpose (referring to the current instance), Python requires it to be explicitly declared as the first parameter of instance methods, whereas in some other languages it is implicit. They should understand how Python's explicit `self` makes the code more readable and avoids ambiguity about whether a variable is local or an instance variable. Students should be able to compare the syntax differences between languages, such as Python's `self.variable` versus Java's `this.variable` or JavaScript's `this.variable`. They should understand how Python's approach to `self` reflects its philosophy of explicit over implicit. Students should be able to explain these differences to programmers familiar with other object-oriented languages.*

**1.3.7 Apply best practices for using self**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for using `self` in their classes. They should understand the importance of consistently using `self` as the first parameter of instance methods, following Python conventions. Students should be able to avoid naming conflicts between `self` and other parameters by choosing clear and descriptive names for other parameters. They should understand how to use `self` only where necessary, avoiding excessive use that can make code harder to read. Students should be able to distinguish between attributes that should be accessed through `self` (instance variables) and those that should be local variables within methods. They should understand how to use `self` to maintain clear boundaries between the interface and implementation of a class. Students should be able to write code that uses `self` consistently and appropriately, following Python conventions and best practices for object-oriented programming.*

**1.4 Understand object lifecycle and memory management**

**1.4.1 Understand object creation and initialization**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain the process of object creation and initialization in Python. They should understand that when a new object is created (e.g., `my_object = MyClass()`), Python first allocates memory for the object, then calls the `__new__` method to create the object, and finally calls the `__init__` method to initialize it. Students should be able to explain that `__new__` is a static method responsible for creating and returning a new instance of the class, while `__init__` is responsible for initializing the newly created instance. They should understand that in most cases, developers only need to define `__init__`, as the default `__new__` method is usually sufficient. Students should be able to trace the sequence of operations during object creation and understand how each step contributes to the final object. They should be able to write classes that properly initialize objects through the `__init__` method.*

**1.4.2 Understand object destruction and the __del__ method**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain the process of object destruction in Python. They should understand that objects are destroyed when they are no longer referenced, at which point Python's garbage collector reclaims the memory. Students should be able to define the `__del__` method, which is called just before the object is destroyed, allowing for cleanup operations. They should understand that `__del__` is similar to destructors in other languages but is not guaranteed to be called in all circumstances, such as when the program terminates abruptly. Students should be able to identify appropriate uses for `__del__`, such as closing files or releasing other resources, and understand its limitations. They should understand that Python's garbage collection uses reference counting, with objects being destroyed when their reference count drops to zero. Students should be able to write classes with `__del__` methods that properly clean up resources when objects are destroyed.*

**1.4.3 Understand Python's garbage collection mechanism**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain Python's garbage collection mechanism, which automatically manages memory by reclaiming objects that are no longer in use. They should understand that Python primarily uses reference counting, where each object keeps track of how many references point to it, and the object is destroyed when this count reaches zero. Students should be able to explain how circular references can prevent objects from being destroyed by reference counting alone, and how Python's generational garbage collector addresses this issue. They should understand how to use the `gc` module to interact with the garbage collector, such as forcing garbage collection or debugging memory issues. Students should be able to identify situations where garbage collection might not work as expected, such as with circular references between objects with `__del__` methods. They should understand how to write code that works effectively with Python's garbage collection mechanism.*

**1.4.4 Manage resources using context managers**
*Guidance: Students should be able to manage resources like files, network connections, or database connections using context managers. They should understand how to create classes that implement the context manager protocol by defining `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. Students should be able to explain that `__enter__` is called when entering the `with` block and should return the resource to be managed, while `__exit__` is called when exiting the block and should handle cleanup, even if an exception occurred. They should understand how to use the `with` statement with objects that implement the context manager protocol. Students should be able to create context managers that ensure resources are properly released, even in the presence of exceptions. They should understand how to use the `@contextmanager` decorator from the `contextlib` module to create context managers more easily using generator functions. Students should be able to write classes that implement the context manager protocol to manage resources effectively.*

**1.4.5 Understand weak references and memory leaks**
*Guidance: Students should be able to explain weak references and their role in preventing memory leaks. They should understand that a weak reference is a reference that doesn't increase the reference count of an object, allowing the object to be garbage collected even if weak references to it exist. Students should be able to use the `weakref` module to create weak references to objects and understand when they are useful, such as in caches or observer patterns. They should understand how weak references can help prevent memory leaks in situations where objects need to reference each other without creating circular references. Students should be able to explain the difference between strong references (which prevent garbage collection) and weak references (which don't). They should understand how to use weak references effectively in their code to manage memory more efficiently. Students should be able to write code that uses weak references appropriately to prevent memory leaks.*

**1.4.6 Implement object copying and comparison**
*Guidance: Students should be able to implement object copying and comparison methods in their classes. They should understand how to define the `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__` methods to control how objects are copied, distinguishing between shallow copies (where the new object contains references to the same nested objects) and deep copies (where nested objects are also copied). Students should be able to define comparison methods like `__eq__` (equality), `__ne__` (inequality), `__lt__` (less than), `__le__` (less than or equal), `__gt__` (greater than), and `__ge__` (greater than or equal) to define how objects of their class are compared. They should understand how to implement the `__hash__` method for objects that need to be used as dictionary keys or set elements. Students should be able to write classes that provide appropriate copying and comparison behavior based on their intended use.*

**1.4.7 Apply best practices for object lifecycle management**
*Guidance: Students should be able to apply best practices for object lifecycle management in their Python programs. They should understand how to design classes that properly initialize objects with all necessary attributes in the `__init__` method. Students should be able to use context managers or the `with` statement to manage resources that need to be released, rather than relying solely on `__del__` methods. They should understand how to avoid circular references or use weak references to prevent memory leaks. Students should be able to implement appropriate copying and comparison methods when needed, following Python conventions. They should understand how to use Python's garbage collection effectively, avoiding unnecessary interference while ensuring resources are properly released. Students should be able to write classes that manage their lifecycle effectively, from creation through initialization to destruction, without causing memory leaks or resource issues.*
